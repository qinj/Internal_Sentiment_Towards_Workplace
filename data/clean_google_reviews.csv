Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.  2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.  3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).  5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.  6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.  2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult."" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.  3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.  4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing. Google says, ""Don't be evil."" But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices. :(","1) Don't dismiss emotional intelligence and adaptive leadership. They're not just catch phases. You need great managers and leaders in order to build great companies and develop great employees. The people who may be brilliant at solving technical issues may not be (and are most often, not) the best candidates for management.  2) Do something about that work-ife balance. Don't just have a bunch of pow-wows and tech talks and discussions about it. Leadership should actually model it. Consider re-evaluating how work is done, what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed?  3) Don't forget that there is already a pool of incredibly talented people within the company. If career development is really a goal at Google, then do it. Don't just hire from the outside. Take the time to help your employees develop their careers - then maybe you won't lose some of the great ones, and maybe you'll have prevent some of that burn out and disillusionment.",4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,2094,Program Manager,0,2013,Jun,2,13.107000000000001,441.01,0
2,3,google,"New York, NY"," May 10, 2014",Current Employee - Software Engineer III,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused). * The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.), overnight ski trips to Vermont, overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer, summer picnics at Chelsea piers, and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially. * Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants. * There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody. * It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are). * The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive. * No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.  Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement. * Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand. * If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding, but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension). * The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows, as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse. * Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Keep the focus on the user.

3,4,google,"Mountain View, CA"," Feb 8, 2015",Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.  You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world  You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.  You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing  You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.  There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.  Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.  Google cares about how it treats its employees.  The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.  There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.  You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.  If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.  The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.  Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.  You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning. No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.  After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear.  It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.  When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you. Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.  It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge. I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.","Keep on NOT micromanaging - that is a huge benefit to Google. Most of us have a huge workload and we work in spikes and not chained to our desks, and we care deeply about producing, and we produce a lot.

4,5,google,"Los Angeles, CA"," Jul 19, 2018",Former Employee - Software Engineer,"Unique, one of a kind dream job","Google is a world of its own. At every other company, there were lots of people who had serious gaps in their skills. At Google, I could have a serious work conversation about technology with everyone and could trust that they have solid expertise. In that way, Google is a sheltered garden from the rest of the world.  There is a general sense of trust in the company. You can leave your valuables and laptops lying around, and they are safe. People joke that it's the only place where you use an expansive laptop to reserve a seat at the cafeteria, while walking away.  At other companies, teams are very protective of their own code. Trying to execute another team's code requires following a 50 step installation process that's out of date and was never complete to begin with. Google has almost all the code in the same source repository. An engineer can look at the code, easily execute the code because it comes with intelligent defaults and standard build process, and contribute enhancements/bug fixes. The other teams are generally grateful for getting improvements. They understand that it's better for the company if the bug is fixed rather than holding onto territory or insisting on their own strange ways.  Google takes care of you all around. From food, health care, generous vacation, onsite gym, and so on, you are well taken care off and can focus on work rather than dealing with life's hassles. There are cases where Google goes above and beyond tremendously. Here is an example that floats around internally. A Googler had worked at Amazon before. Amazon relocated him. Because of the relocation, he had to change his partner's health insurance for some critical and expensive life changing medication. Due to same sex partner and relocation, the health insurance company refused. Amazon was so unhelpful that the HR representative who was forced to deliver the news broke down crying and then quit over it. He switched to Google. The Google HR department negotiated an exception for him with the health insurance and included the necessary change for the following policy year for all employees.  A lot of Google products have a huge impact with over a billion users. Working there, you can feel that you change the world.  I was very happy with the compensation. There are also a lot of opportunities in the company to follow your interest. Pretty much anyone can get an intern, participate in setting coding standards (obviously you have to argue the case for your proposals), interviewing, supporting local schools with tech expertise. Google opened up a lot of opportunities in the community or in general in tech to volunteer in.  Google is considered the largest functioning anarchy. That has its good sides, like the glee of joy for operating without strict oversight. It also has its dark side, like a hands-off management tends to encourage politics.  Another beauty for engineers are internal tools. Your development environment is in the cloud. You can sit down at a loaner computer and be productive within seconds. There is a massive cloud compiling system that shards your compiles across many computers in the cloud. The search function across the codebase is powerful. You'll feel that downloading and compiling code on your own computer in your IDE is something of another epoch, like something from before the industrial revolution.  The Google badge is a wonderful thing to carry. It opens doors to a different world. The office spaces are beautiful with work, rest, and play areas. The MTV location is like a utopian city on its own. Everything in it, food, drinks, work spaces, swimming pools, gym, bowling alleys, showers, and so on are free (for employees). It is a whole world of its own.  Most companies have a one-over-one promotion model. Your boss has to decide to promote you. Your bosses boss has to sign off on it. At Google, the promotion is decided by a relatively impartial committee that due to promoting lots of people has experience in it. You can even get promoted in rare cases against the will of your manager. Rumor has it that managers won't hold a grudge if that happens but support it. The hiring committee looks at a promotion packet that includes reviews from peers. There can even be unrequested peer reviews. In general, it creates an environment that discourages bicycling - bowing to the higher ups and kicking the lower downs hard. However some people have realized that they can hurt colleagues with bad reviews and impunity. It's rare, but colleagues careers took a dive due to someone holding a grudge or simply writing a thoughtless review. (There is some concern about stack ranking, but I don't understand enough of the background to comment on it. There are plenty of discussions with insight elsewhere.)  To underscore how Google is one of a kind, there is an internal database with legendary things that happened at Google. Someone parked his car for many years on the employee parking lot. When after years, he went looking for his car, it was gone. He went to security. He found out that it was simply moved because the parking lot had been repaved. Another Googler lived in the office fulltime to save money on rent. He wrote a guide on how to do that. As there are showers and other facilities, it is possible to do so. And Google let it happen. After a while of saving rent payment, he could afford the down payment on buying his own place. All these stories make Google a wonderful place to work at.  An important topic to bring up is work/life balance. Work/life balance is an amorphous topic that means a lot of different things to different people. Getting up to speed at Google is consuming. Depending on your work, it could take a year to become productive. Many colleagues reported no longer having a personal life after starting at Google. Some colleagues simply love technology and can't think of anything better than working until the AM hours on some tech that gets them excited. You can tell these people by physically looking at them. For them, it is a heaven. If you are a balanced person with personal interests and relationships, you are likely going to be challenged. If you signed up for one of the big five tech companies, you wanted challenge, right. If I would do something differently, it is to take advantage of all time saving things. Pay for a laundry service. Pay for a cleaning service. I've had a moral hangup about doing that because on a moral level, my time shouldn't be more worthy than that of another human being. If I could do it all over again, I'd pay for every possible service to save time. In the grander scheme of things, if you work at Google, your skill is so valuable to humanity that you should make use of it instead of standing in line at the grocery store. I don't mean that in an arrogant way. If you work on a service with a billion users, your ability to make life better for them with another hour of work is worth more than folding laundry. You've paid the price in education, training, and effort to be able to do that. Make use of your power for the great code. (The view that all those perks are only there to keep your nose closer to the grindstone is the wrong way of looking at it from a philosophical point, in my humble opinion.)  For full disclosure, there are some people who coast at Google. They probably don't have any complains about work/life balance or perhaps the worst complaints because they are all about coasting.  Many company mishandle projects. When the next time comes around, they mishandle it in the same way because the people responsible aren't the ones working late nights and weekends. Google does two things to get better: (1) There are honest and public postmortems. They are the pride of a lot of true engineers. (2) Zeitgeist is an annual survey about the work place and the company. The survey is quite exhaustive. Every manager from the CEO to the front-line manager reports on the result of his/her area. Then they take actions to attempt to improve areas that got low scores. Having worked at companies where now improvement effort is done, this annual and systematic process is very refreshing.","If you don't work in MTV (HQ), you will be given work. However if you are passionate and want to advance your career, you should relocated to MTV. Any project that started doing well and getting important seemed to get transferred there. Promotion opportunities are better there. It seemed that everyone who relocated from another location to MTV, was a lot happier.  Officially, the company focuses on impact. In practice, it seems to focus on being highly productive in producing code, but not necessarily in actually succeeding. In theory, if you have a simple idea that doubles the revenue/customer satisfaction, it should be more appreciated than an idea that took a lot of effort/difficulty and had less improvement. But it tends to be the other way.  Promotions tend to be tied to launching a project that makes peers at a higher level happy. That's often easier with an API that happens to be really useful for peers than launches that benefit users. Landing the right kind of project to work on is a big factor of getting a promotion, which is easier in MTV and also encourages politics. A colleague was told directly from his boss that he has to get better at ""turf war.""  A general rule of thumb is that everyone ends up in ads. Non-ads projects tend to be more volatile and have a tendency to end with people ending up on ads projects. This is not necessarily a con. One should simply prepare for it.  There seems to be a general trend as Google gets larger (60K+ employees) and the founders are withdrawing their impact on the company that Google's specialty is fading a bit. Microkitchens stock less eye popping snacks and drinks. The Christmas gift went from a nice bundle of cash to a coveted phone to a cheap phone to simply a donation to a charity of your choice. The hiring bar seems to get lowered to satisfy the need to hire more people.  Managers tend to become managers for their tech skills and not management skills. It definitely shows in the quality of management. Very smart people, very technically capable, not so business and people savvy. This is not necessarily a complete con because a manager without a clue in tech is definitely a lot worse.  There are some stars that people belief that Google still has but doesn't. The myth of 20% time is alive outside of Google. It's discouraged inside of Google. The only person whom I knew to participate in 20% time did so by working on another team, which he wanted to test out before transferring. Outside people belief that 1 day a week a Google can work on anything he/she deems interesting. Management doesn't outright deny it, but it's formulated as: If you work 20% time on something else, it has to have company impact worth 20%. This is not necessarily a con. It's more like a missing pro.  Another shining star that's gone is the ""don't be evil"" motto. It was silently dropped and replaced with ""do the right thing."" Google didn't turn overnight evil. There is some philosophical case to be made why the new motto is better. However it seems with the founders drawing back from company involvement that the dramatic standing up for users of the old times is also fading. Google is still a far cry from Monsanto.  If you work there and want to advance your career, don't volunteer for anything. It is kind of viewed as a ""vacation"" if you volunteer for things. For example at other employers, interviewing was viewed as a prestigious activity reserved for the most trusted employees to shape the future. At Google, any hour you spend interviewing means missing an hour to increase your performance score. You'll be rewarded for finding ways to dug out of the interviewing responsibility. Again this is not necessarily a con, simply something to understand.  You are going to meet some of the brightest and most brilliant people. You are going to meet people with interesting backgrounds. You are going to have wonderfully engaging conversations. But all of that intelligence tends to also have caused nature to create that intelligence at a trade-off (in some people). Perhaps a lack of humanity or emotion was the price of it in some people. You are going to have some lunch conversations that are going to make you spit your food back out, like a colleague seriously proposing to use nuclear bombs to solve social issues. I sometimes felt the need to take a break from the office to be around people who display normal emotions (or any emotion). While the general office culture is very liberal/progressive, there are some pockets of social beliefs that are breathtaking to how little they care about human life or different lifestyles/opinions out of some law of the strong or ultra libertarian reasoning.",Promote managers into management for their manager skills.

Google does not do anything small - it's go big or go home. - Continuous learning and development - the g2g program encourages googlers to be constantly learning and growing.

There is increasingly a lot of bureaucracy, promotions and performance management systems don't always reward top performance but rather who's been in line longest, and it's harder to get things done when you need approval from 15 different teams. - Google Cloud is growing fast... But they're sacrificing culture and quality hiring for getting warm bodies to fill seats. The culture is increasingly toxic and it doesn't feel like Google - with all the focus on external hiring in Google Cloud, it feels more like VMware v2 or mini Amazon and that's not what I signed up for. - Internal transfers are almost harder than getting into the company in the first place.

They do an excellent job of outlining our company-wide mission, and fostering employees sense of personal responsibility to execute on that mission. The famous (or infamous, depending on your perspective) perks are just as enticing and rewarding as the hyperbole surrounding them.","Unfortunately, buses, on-site laundry, and massages don't pay the bills. Google pays exceptionally well, if you're on the engineering side of the company. If not, compensation hardly lives up to the hype. Example: an individual started in an entry-level role and was later moved into a position with much greater impact and significantly more responsibility within the same department. A year and a half later, that individual is still being paid at their entry-level pay and classified as their entry-level role, despite a complete change of responsibilities, scope of impact, skill requirements, etc.","Internal mobility rules / bureaucracy need a thorough overhaul. Internal rules require that an employee cannot apply for a role outside of their level (L1, L2, L3, etc.) Think purely lateral moves (changing roles) or purely vertical moves (promotions,) but diagonal moves (promotion into a new role) aren't allowed. Unfortunately, this creates pockets of stagnant employees, who have no opportunities for movement, laterally or vertically. For instance, there are approximately a half dozen departments that have full-time employees at the L2 level. But many of those teams do not have an L3 role that doesn't require people-management responsibilities. Obviously, there are a finite number of L3 roles as there is a finite number of people to manage. These L2 employees are effectively capped from promotion until an L3 leaves or is promoted (a frequency of approx 2 per year.) L2's are also boxed in laterally, as there are so few teams that offer L2 roles, meaning they are unable to transition into a role that offers greater vertical opportunities. For comparison, the vast majority of entry-level positions at Google (65% - 75%) are at the L3 or L4 levels, meaning that these employees are able to move freely between teams / departments / product areas, and thus circumvent the majority of these issues.",3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3,Project Coordinator,1,2018,Apr,2,32.657,1217.26,0

Everyone is trying to get promoted to make more money, and the system around promotion encourages the wrong kinds of risk-taking: bold but useless new products, hoarding credit, blaming others for your mistakes. - If a product is at risk, one or two people may be collectively blamed to save the whole.

Many PMs and managers are wonderful. It depends on the team you get, which is largely a question of luck. - A culture which somewhat coddles through its benefits leads some to stay dependent and socially immature, especially if joined right out of college.","- Make switching teams easier. - If it takes 20 people to promote someone, it should not take only one to fire.

Positions fall into 3 categories, company paid drivers, independent drivers and company paid Para Monitors. These Para Monitors are responsible for the safety of the passengers during transport, generally behaviorally challenged young people with special needs. Drivers are paid by the trip or the hour depending on their classification. Company drivers get assigned generally the long time because the company brings in more revenue. The independents are generally assigned short overflow trips which can earned them as little as $7-10. These drivers pay for their own vehicle, gasoline, insurance and on their own time. Drivers are in great demand due to the extremely high turnover, averaging 3-4 months. Lastly are the Para Monitors who are paid $50 per day for 2 split shift trips. The average work week is presented as approximately 14 hours as opposed to getting paid for 20. Great deal if you aren’t actually working 18-20. Due to the chaotic scheduling you will work one Para trip the remaining hours you will be dragged along with the driver because they lack the time to drop you off at the office. This is regardless if you have a appointment already scheduled. Sadly, it is totally impossible to schedule any personal obligations, such as shopping, doctor’s appointments and the like. The Boss lies when cornered regarding hours stating you are MINE from 6AM – 6PM. The work force is composed for the most part of house wives, retirees, and immigrants. These are the types of people that are focused for employment because they will generally take any kind of treatment and be happy to have a job, however many don’t last long. If you have a conflict with the tyrant boss you most likely will be unemployed shortly. She manages by intimidation. In her quest to terminate you and still not appear to be a tyrant she has been known to elicit the assistance of certain favorite personnel to assist her by lying and discrediting the employee in question. I know of an employee who required a sick day and was told they had to come in and fill out a request for a day off. If they didn’t follow that procedure it could be terms for termination. That employee could not make it in to fill out the request and was terminated. Lying to the employees is commonplace. To quote the big white tyrannical Boss, she stated on one occasion when someone took issue with something “forget them, they are a dime a dozen.” That certainly explains why the Boss focuses on hiring a certain type of individual. Employees are too terrified of the Boss and her insane attitude to standup for their rights for fear of being terminated or reprisal. Which is another whole talent the Boss’s takes to new limits.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8,Anonymous Employee,0,2018,Feb,1,31.146,1017.33,0

Fantastic name to have on your resume,"I loved working at Google until I was unlucky enough to be transferred into a team with a bad people manager. This manager ruled through confusion and an iron fist, most likely because it was clear that the entire team was smarter than this manager. I had no clear direction on my role, or even what the outcome of the project the team was working on, no matter how many times I asked. I quickly became bored and frustrated and soon realized that I was not learning anything new, and the transferrable skills I did bring were not being utilized. That's when I started looking outside the company, and here is what I found at my new job: 25% increase in salary, 50% more vacation time and 150% increase in bonus target. Once I left, I realized just how old fashioned Google really is regarding Management, Performance Reviews, and other HR-related issues. Perf and Calibration were abandoned by most companies years ago because it doesn't work in identifying the best performers, but at Google it defines you forever. Lastly, during orientation the advice given to the Nooglers is ""don't be a jerk"". It turns out that I have never worked at a company that had more jerks than Google. The egos and arrogance I encountered were off the charts. It was easy to overlook when I liked what I was doing, but once I was put under the bad manager my eyes were opened to the ugly reality of working at Google.",Recognize and stop the empire building that's going on at the lower levels.

Surrounded by smart researchers. Shuttle for commuting.,"Promotion process too arbitrary. I got extremely good ratings but still was passed over for far too long. Promo still requires a ""launch"" with a right kind of metrics to impress the committee.  Bay Area too expensive. I'm leaving for Seattle -- it's expensive too, but it's *possible* to buy a condo/house there without a ridiculous commute. The past 5 years of price-doubling have prevented me from getting into the market even at my good software engineer salary. Priced out of market -- seriously. The people who can bear to live near work are married Google couples, new grads from India or China living together crammed into crappy small houses... or people who bought a place 5 years ago before $750k, 2 bedroom, 1200 sq ft houses became $1.5M.  My skills were note utilized, I couldn't get transferred onto the right teams where I could apply my Ph.D. research.","When someone like me gets Strongly Exceeds Expectations 3 times in a row (that's 1.5 years) it's high time for promotion. I'm leaving because I wasn't promoted from 4 to 5 despite long-term dedicated efforts to do so, whereas I have an offer for an L5-6 equivalent position in another major company. I would have stayed indefinitely otherwise. But now I realize that even if I get a promo soon, I'll only get a 6% raise (per policy) and it will still take a year for the RSU benefits to start catching me up to the next level comp. Meanwhile I can get a 25% raise tomorrow by jumping ship. **Note that the delay between ""prove you're performing at the next level for a year (or much more)"" combined with ""RSUs awarded later on, total comp will catch up eventually..."" means that I'll be underpaid for 2 years or so if I stay.**  This matters since, while waiting for promo, I've been priced out of the housing market. My friends who are married with a spouse at Google are house-hunting, and younger ones are living together in 5 bedroom places. I'm married and need some privacy, my wife doesn't work, so there's no way to live close to work and I'm sick of commuting. If I had made it to L5 when I applied I'd afford to be staying, but now it's too late.  Also, when I have specialized skills from my Ph.D. and I'm constantly getting moved to projects that aren't making use of those skills, it's annoying. ""Headcount"" issues on super-appropriate teams for me kept me out of the positions where I would be most useful to Google by applying my Ph.D. work. So I'm taking my talent elsewhere.  All in all, I was greatly disappointed by:  * Extremely slow time-to-promo (due to higher-ups cancelling projects... out of my control).  * Advanced to lead a team of 6 people, at only level 4 (a ""junior"" role where explicit team leadership is very uncommon) and yet still the promo process didn't value my contribution, even though my manager and director did.  * Cost of living in the Bay Area, and resultant time to commute (Gbus was great but it got old after 5 years)  * Stuck on wrong projects, due to headcount issues/timing/18-months-on-team-before-transfer policy. And bait-and-switch for my initial team due a ""headcount problem"" where I didn't get into the expected team in the first place.  * Not valued for my Ph.D. speciality skills, but simply as a software engineer. I'm moving to a company that needed *me* in particular, and I'm joining a particular team.

I leave knowing that what I worked on had true impact on others personally and professionally. I was lucky to have the mentors and champions I did.,"It is a sink or swim environment. Wonderful perks but they are there to keep you at work longer. People don't leave jobs, they leave managers. Google has a long way to go when it comes to training their managers effectively and actually making sure they represent the initiatives Google is in the news for such as Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. I went from amazing managers and sponsors to the worst manager ever. Just because a manager takes a course doesn't mean they have adopted the lessons taught.  I suffer from a disability that is episodic and goes into remission at times. At the end of my time with Google, despite needs for accommodations due to my disability, my manager declined a request to work in a quieter and more private work space. HR took their time. In addition, I was only allowed to work from home on Fridays. I was also penalized on my performance review for not being able to work in a more visible work space. This is important to note. I went from a high performing employee for 4+ years and then got sick and within 3-4months was rated as a Needs Improvement by my manager who had only managed me for 3 months and the one before 5 months. At Google, your MANAGER has the final say on your performance review. Despite high ratings from everyone else, HR stands firm about letting the managers rating be the overall rating and override all other reviewers.  Google needs to understand that not all people work or learn the same way. Don't expect reasonable accommodations to be honored here. They took 6 weeks to respond to my drs note for a medically necessary accommodation. This is NOT a space if you have any type of disability especially cognitive or mental ones. There is a whole internal email disability group which provides a community for many of us who are struggle from our disability and not our jobs. However, no one from HR has bothered to address the true struggles that people with disabilities are facing.","It is not enough to just have programs on Psychological Safety and Unconscious Bias. Google needs to do a better job vetting and deciding who moves into a management role. I loved my job and I was great at it. The change to two new managers in less than 6 months was not only too much for me to take but for our team of 10. Manager survey reports are enough. What are the chances that the managers report is going to tell you that the managers you put in place last lacked so little empathy, compassion, and support and was so goal driven that they pushed 2 of their 10 reports onto medical leave. Google, you are losing tons of top talent because people don't fit into a particular mold. The truth of the matter is that sooooo much top talent can be saved with very minor accommodations. There needs to be an Advocate for those who have disabilities to mediate with HR or managers when needed. So many managers are caught up in their day to day that despite being educated on Unconscious Bias .... they just can't see their biases because they are so caught up on performance. You can't know what you don't know just like many of these managers can't see their biases. You can't see what you can't see and a short workshop or online course is not enough to make you see it, identify it and change it. Google, you need someone to be identifying and challenging managers in real life to challenge their biases and to come in and advocate for those with disabilities. Many other companies already have this role and it is truly unfortunate that a large company such as Google at the forefront of so much does not.  ""Many of us, particularly those of us with disabilities who have faced persistent discrimination throughout our lives, not least when trying to find employment in the first place, take enormous pride in our hard-fought jobs and careers.""- Stella Young. For many with disabilities, it is a dream come true to work at Google.

It is very difficult to rise the ranks, as this reputation follows you throughout your career journey. - A significant amount of account strategists and direct sales employees within the organization are extremely unhappy.

The work is mundane and people are constantly complaining as the organization continues to operate across the same metrics, incentives, and programs that it has been for almost 10 years.

You will find out you should have moved on way too late. - The hiring bar has severely decreased as the company gets larger. Mediocre employees are hired based on industry experience, but have a very hard time ramping up to Google's way of doing things, and are often unable to keep up. - The process of performance reviews and promotions will at one way or another negatively impact you. It is one of the most dramatic processes, especially in this organization. There are long lists of people 'waiting' to rise to the next level in the company as people are ranked, forcing you to wait your turn in a slowly-moving cycle of burnt out individuals waiting for their recognition.

If a direct manager likes an employee, then it's a walk in the park, otherwise prepare to be stonewalled or have to resort to some serious brown-nosing to get ahead. Also, leveling-up gets super competitive due to the large size of the company. Transferring teams is a challenge, so most employees grin and bear it for a couple of years, or leave the company. It's hard for outsiders to understand, but this happens to a lot of Nooglers, and ""re-Noogler"" events are done for employees that complete their first year.

Politics among teams and Orgs slow everything down, often leading to delayed launches, buggy releases and zero transparency. Also, there's an awfully large amount of bad managers.

Pros is google overall cares for its people but it's the management that either keeps that up or messes it up.  You will work with the most brilliant people ever which is usually a good thing but it can also be a bad thing which I'll discuss below.

I got talked two twice and the third time I got pulled into a room with my manager telling me I had to work at my desk even though I was the top performer on the team. There were major trust issues.  Management is truly hit or miss. My first manager was literally in meetings all day and no one got face time. He ended up leaving because he ended up not liking it anymore. Second manager I loved and the team was perfect but she ended up transferring due to how she felt she was treated. The new manager was terrible, pulled down the morale and 3 people transferred out after 3 months. Third manager was brand new and no one trusted her. 3 people left within 3 months. Good management is hard to come by.  Competitiveness runs rampant to the point that people will steel your work. If you bring it up like I did after seeing it happen to me 3+ times, management told me that's the way Google grooms people and it makes people become competitive.  You're surrounded by brilliant people but the imposter syndrome is strong at Google. The way performance reviews are set up, you always have to come up with random stuff to outdo yourself and make you look good. That's good to push you out of your comfort zone but bad because people start making up useless things to show they've been doing stuff. It's silly really. And this is why it's incredibly hard to get promoted is that you have to outdo yourself and outshine your peers.

It lost it's values.,"Overall compensation, although it is getting worse and worse every year.","Being programmer means being creative. Well, not at Google. You will have artificially created restraints in almost every aspect of your work.  Here is an example: readability. In order to being able to commit some code at Google you would need to have a ""readability"" in a language you're writing this piece of a code. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience in that language. It doesn't matter if you have certificate from the company that developed this language. And in order to get readability you would need to write a lot of code in that language. Catch-22. Also, you would have to wait for a pretty long time in the readability queue in order to just start with process. You fill like you lost all the experience you had before with this language. Somebody who has readability and has less experience in this language than you will have power over you. You would have to persuade this other person that your code is OK.  Hypocrisy. They still have courses at Google where they teach you that it is important to have a rest, it is important to manage your energy, it is important to work when you are excited and energized and not work when you're not. This is why they have all those massage chairs. It used to be the company that valued all this. It all changed. I saw my manager writing in 2am and then writing in 6am again. Manager sets an example for it's subordinates and this example is terrible. I also remember my manager writing email about his current state that he is sick. At the same email he tells that ""he will do his best to do some work"". At the same time this same manager tells everybody else that ""if you're sick - go home and take a rest and don't work"". I lost respect for my manager long time ago.  They want you to deliver results as soon as possible and yet they don't give you the ability to do it. Instead of JUST DOING IT you would have to write design docs with the future possible architecture (which will always be different because we can't predict software development) and persuade people who have more power than you. Those people will do their best to make sure you don't just start working on your code. You would have to pass several rounds of this absurd.  They told me it is very important to predict how much time it would take to finish the project. I asked them what is the technique to predict unpredictable and got no answer in return. They told me it is very important to make sure you did your project as close to your predictions as possible. I asked them what stops people from deliberately giving very large estimates, completing a project sooner and just do nothing for the rest of the time. I got no answer in return. I completely lost respect this company. This is absurd. The management don't think about what they are doing and why. They don't think about their own behavior and they own words.",none,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,28,Software Engineer III,0,2016,Nov,4,26.01,796.79,0

These people want to look better to senior leadership/get more hires/justify their roles. - Different experience dependent on what team you're on: Dynamics vary a lot. Often, your boss must be vocal enough or well liked in order for you to succeed (as the person below them) since you have no access to upper leaders. - Poor Management & Leadership: Just really bad in a lot of cases and don't really know what's going on. Lack of product knowledge and it's very obvious. - Promotions are selective: ""Favorites"" will often be easily promoted, when others may deserve it more. There is only a certain # of people who can be promoted every cycle. - At times, feels like a sexist environment for women: Males favored, listened to more, and ""boys club"" mentality at management level. - ""Flat"" organization but very hierarchical: Try to hire smart, experienced people in at the low level, meaning you must do everything on your own and feels like you're alone on an island of 1 without help or anyone to manage/hire in below you. Managers are usually people who have been at Google for a long time, and they are the ones with access to the senior leadership teams. - Hiring: Takes a long time. They say they only hire ""smart people"", however, the company is so big now, that's really impossible... many employees are not as smart or cool as Google advertises. - Unwilling to allow transfers to other offices: If you like Mountain View, great! If you do not like Mountain View, which most people do not, good luck with trying to transfer offices and stay in your current role. Internal transfers are also not as easy as advertised. - Bureaucracy: It's a huge company. Don't expect it to be all roses or feel like a small, fun company.

Within this role and organization, you receive a great deal of respect and prestige from your clients, as they look to you for strong business guidance. The pay is very competitive, and if you have a supportive manager, the potential to gain merit raises annually is very high (as are the stock refreshes).

Don't believe everything you read in the press about how fantastic Google work culture is. Although the HR department has made multiple attempts to improve the promotion structure at Google, it can be near impossible to navigate all of the appropriate politics to gain a promotion. Furthermore, a promotion in the sales org at Google does not necessarily mean an increase in responsibility or a title change. Employees usually work in roles 1-2 levels above them in order to first demonstrate that they are worthy of promotion. In this same vein, the opportunities for growth are VERY few within this org, and you often find people moving from industry to industry (within the sales org) to keep their day-to-day interesting. There is a huge bottleneck for middle management to make their way into leadership positions. Most importantly, the leadership within the sales org is severely lacking.

For example, team off-sites. It does suck when your colleagues are raving about how they really bonded during the team's off-site, and you can't really relate. Sense of connecting is really important at a work place, and sense you are restricted from having that even if your work excels your peers can't fully scope it because the lack of connection.  You don't get all the knowledge. You are blocked from participating in Grow classes that the rest of your team gets.

While you're juggling to keep up, while being financially stable in this ridiculously economy.  You do learn from your colleagues. Well, the nice ones but (yes, even at Google) there are mean and very mean people. Even management is mean. Not everyone at Google is Googley (that's a fact). Especially, once they see your red badge. Once they see red it is like the respect is gone. Some do treat TVCs as though they are slaves whose knowledge is mediocre and opinions don't matter. From my experience thus far, Google consist of 15% genuinely nice, 20% nice, 35% mean, and 30% really mean people. Oh, and the majority of the 15% are TVCs.  My experience: You work your butt off and are doing the same work as your full-time teammates for below market pay with very little to sometimes no recognition. Your opinions do not matter. They only bought you on to do the hard slave labor.","Google please change how you treat your TVCs. We aren't just slaves. We are smart and hardworking people.

If you want to grow, you have to seek out opportunities and prove that your worth. This keeps you motivated. - Tons of interesting projects. There is no dearth of challenging projects that will keep you interested for years. Mobility within the company is easy as long as you are good performer. - You get to work with some very smart people and that makes you perform a notch above. - Management is intentionally less involved in an engineer's life and this avoids micromanagement, bias and single point of failure. This goes with point #1. You are free to define what can be done in your domain (of course you have to sell it). - a lot of basic infra exists and is exceptional. So you don't have to spend too much time on your ""means"" to the end. - pay for performance: if you are a good performer, you are taken care of. - needless to say, perks are amazing. - at Google you will learn a lot of things and you will learn it from the best. IMHO, I don't see a lot of engineers wanting to learn once they graduate, even from undergrad. They want to be person that build the next biggest thing. It's great if you truly have that skill.","- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positives in every step and false negatives are inevitable. At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something.  - You have to have skill to find impactful areas or projects or start one in order to grow fast. A lot of people can't or don't want to do that. They want it lying there in a platter in front of them (I don't mean this disrespectfully. I have been there). This is why smaller companies or startups look attractive. It's easier to grow in a less competitive place and there is nothing wrong in wanting that.  In my experience, a lot of people who say Google is boring and young & smaller companies are those that are good at building things and solving problems that a thousand other engineers can solve. They just want a place where it hasn't been solved. At google, a lot of your basic services and infra are built. So the problems to solve get substantially more difficult and requires some lateral thinking as well. Again, no disrespect. There are lot of people out there, including me, who would like interesting problems handed over to us.  - in a place of this size, you have to navigate some political issues.  - in critical systems like search, you can just push new things (rightfully so).

2620,2621,google,"New York, NY"," Oct 5, 2015",Former Employee - Systems Administrator,"Great company, but your mileage WILL vary.","* Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level.  * There are tons and tons AND TONS of teams at Google working on close to anything that you can think of, technical or not, and transferring between them is actually encouraged as long as you're on good standing performance-wise.  * Feedback is taken very seriously at Google. It's paramount to their culture and it shows: the Food department cares a lot about turning out high-quality food, People Ops does everything they can to make the employee experience a happy one, etc. Even though it's kind-of a talking piece now, the TGIF sessions with Larry, Sergey and top management are unprecedented.  * The food is quite good most of the time. Some of it's restaurant-quality, even. (It highly depends on the cafe you go to and the food you typically eat.)  * Aside from a tech startup, I can't think of any other place that's on the bleeding edge of technology at this scale. Google is highly, highly experimental, almost to a fault. (More on that in the ""Cons."")  * Their benefits are really generous for a large org. They're not insanely so compared to others like them, but all of the basics (and then some!) are covered.  * If you like free stuff, Google will bury you with it over time. I didn't work there very long but somehow got two backpacks, a few shirts and a hoodie. Interns get way more stuff, though.","A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.  * Your experience at Google will largely depend on your team and/or manager. If you join a bad team and/or a bad manager, you'll be in for a rough 12 months (the minimum amount of time that's usually required to transfer out.)  * ANYTHING you do or create outside of work is owned by Google, regardless of whether you used their resources or not to do it. This could be a HUGE issue for you if you contribute heavily to open-source and/or like to build side projects. Google's People Ops **do** look out for people doing this too.  * The compensation is okay depending on where you're coming from, but salary is practically non-negotiable (stock units are more flexible, though) and might not even be competitive depending on your area. Lots of funded startups and finance shops pay significantly better for the same level of experience. Additionally, compensation doesn't scale relative to growth. One could double their salary or more within the same amount of time it takes to get from mid-range to senior at Google.  * Almost everything that an engineer at Google uses on a daily basis is home-grown and maintained by other Googlers. Much of this tooling is incredibly complicated and takes months to warm up to. This could be a MAJOR brain drain to consider depending on your career path and/or whether you're thinking of staying at Google long-term. (That said, some of the tools were pretty good, though I usually preferred third-party alternatives for many of the others I worked with.)  * Most of the sexy projects that makes Google Google are in Mountain View, and if you really want to take your career at Google seriously, you'll eventually have to move out there. Living costs in the Bay are insane and show no signs of restoring sanity any time soon.  * Despite having all of the infrastructure to support it, remotely working is generally discouraged by most teams. That said, many, MANY meetings are done completely or partially with Hangouts and Google's solution for accessing internal resources from public endpoints is probably the best there is.  * Their interview process is generally terrible. Engineers at Google generally don't like to interview and/or provide feedback, so the interview experience for potential candidates varies wildly across the board. The process also takes a really long time. It took me about four months to get to the offer stage, apparently, that's normal there. (To put this into perspective, I've worked at places that took a week from cold start to signed offer, they can't possibly not be losing talent from these insane delays.)  * I don't remember seeing more people glued to their phone or laptop in a single workplace before coming here. It seems like almost everyone travels while glued to their phone here. It's maddening.  * Most interviews are focused almost entirely on technical merit. This makes it (much) more likely for engineers with strong technical skills but (very) weak social skills to make it through the cracks. If you're more outgoing and ""extroverted,"" this might bother you. (It bothered me to no end.)  * There's lots of exciting work being done at Google, but more exciting work usually means even more operational work. A lot of extremely capable people get slotted into doing that sort of work. Do as much research as you can on your role to give you an idea of what you're getting into.  * Technical merit is placed above all else as an engineer. Because this is a significant determinant in promotion decisions, a lot of people spend a lot of time doing ""complex and impactful"" work at the expense of things like documentation or maintainability. As you might imagine, this leads to a lot of reinvented wheels and deprecation. (It doesn't help that every project seemingly *has* to have a name to it that might or might not have anything to do with the project that describes it.)  * Work-life balance HIGHLY depends on your team. In my experience, people at Google that spent a lot of time working after-hours did so on their own volition (for better or worse). Management never pressured me to work more than I wanted to, in fact, they've had to tell people to ease up!","You really need to pay your people better. The market's catching up to you.

That it's the first thing mentioned is kind of analogous to people first mentioning ""good weather"" when talking about the pros California.  -Author talks at Google are good opportunities to meet authors, and offer nice perspectives from outside the tech bubble. I need to take advantage of this more.  -Engineering culture. I've worked at places before that treated engineers as more of a means to an end, instead of involving them more in the process. Nice role reversal here, though it probably still needs some balance.  -Looks good on your resume  -Good place to start your career, though be careful because you can't take much with you (or you will want to recreate tech on the outside when you get out).  -20% time still exists (depends on the team)  -work-life balance (depends on the team)  -Can become too comfortable and insular and not challenging, which can hurt your career later on.

Because it is.  -Lots of NIH and Google-specific libraries which folks can't take with them when they leave. The outside world operates very differently and with different technologies, and people won't learn much of that here unfortunately.  -Lack of freedom to choose technologies. A lot of solutions exist on the outside, but there's often a homegrown competitor that we're forced to use, so it will make that other team look good (lots of folks write libraries and services just to get promoted).  -No Node.js support in production. This is especially painful for aqui-hires because many startups these days use Node. Then they find they need to re-write everything to integrate with Google.  -Checkin + code review process is super bloated, anal retentive, and obsessive. This slows down development time considerably. This is especially painful for aqui-hires, where no one on the team has readability, so you have to make friends within Google just to get your code checked in. Really, really frustrating and the feeling that productivity has gone down immensely.  -Still not a good environment for frontend engineers. If you even hint that you like JavaScript and CSS, people will look at you like you have brain damage. Not a lot of the engineering culture values FE work, although that's a self-admitted problem that they're trying to change.  -Fiscal irresponsibility. Hiring rate within the last few years has been out of control and unsustainable. There is a boom time now, but this is going to hurt and result in many layoffs when the next crash happens.  -Engineering culture (also listed as a pro above). Specifically non-frontend engineering. This is reflected in the ridiculous interview process. It would be good to get more diversity of thought and perspectives, not just a hard-line engineering perspective. So many decisions are based on quantitative data alone, which is a mistake if a company wants to push the boundaries and wants to be innovative.  -Entitlement and elitism.

This means your coworkers will likely be very interesting and fun, and you'll probably enjoy the office environment immensely. You'll learn a lot. The hours are very flexible and the company takes the notion of work-life balance as it applies to the workday very seriously (though there's a dark reason for this). And the perks are second to none. Compensation is also quite competitive as you rise through the ranks.  And the food! I still dream about the food.  It's a great place to build a stable career if you love coding but aren't super-entrepreneurial and don't make tons of contributions to open source projects (see the cons for why these would be issues). The workplace environment is often replicated, but nobody else has matched it yet.","The cons are flipped versions of the pros: Google hires very smart people and then puts them in fairly mundane roles. They used to try to take your preferences into account when allocating, they seem to do much less of this as they've grown. If you're at all purpose-driven, you'll eventually become restless at work, looking for something with more meaning than the project you're on. You could potentially 20% something, but that notion has always applied more to some groups than others, and the company has tended to downplay it in recent years.  More disturbingly, there's a severe opportunity cost to your side projects: their position is that everything that you do in your personal time belongs to them, although that is not what the employment agreement says and would be an unenforceable position in California. They instead get around this by suggesting that everything that touches the web or mobile (and perhaps the desktop as well) is competitive with them. There's a committee that will examine ideas, but it appears to be moribund.  Google has grown tremendously, and systematized to the point where it's a large machine, needing an increasing number of cogs to keep the engine running. The culture has been eroding recently because the company hasn't been able to reconcile it with its growth, and because the company has sidetracked from its core mission and thrown resources at ""me-too"" projects such as Google+. I predict that this will hurt the company's outlook in the long term, as most of its revenue generation still comes from relatively few core activities which are exposed to market and competitive risks. As it becomes less entrepreneurial, it becomes less able to diversify into new areas, and thus becomes less resilient. I would expect this to take 5-10 years to become apparent (the market would need to shift in a way that causes one of their pillars to collapse), which means that it may not be an issue for most people considering it now.  One other thing I've found is that while they care collectively about their engineers a great deal, they're generally not very willing to go out on a limb to make individuals happy. Food and facilities people are the exception, as they do often take engineers' feedback into account.","Recapture the entrepreneurial spirit and let the creative people you hired innovate.

When I need assistance from another engineer or another team, I typically get quick and effective help. Office politics exist, but compared to anywhere else I've worked they're not a problem.  - Compensation / perks: I'm very satisfied with my compensation. The assorted perks are pretty valuable as well -- the food and fitness facilities are my favorites.  - Work/life balance: From reading other reviews here it seems that experiences in this area vary. But mine have been excellent. I rarely work over 40 hours a week, and when I do it's because I personally feel engaged by what I'm working on, never because of pressure from my manager or team lead. I almost never check work emails during evenings or weekends, and when I come in to the office in the morning I don't find that they've been emailing me during that period. I actually have gotten gentle pushback from my team lead when I asked if he could log in from home later in the evening to review/approve a change I wanted to submit.","- Impostor syndrome: The flip side of working with so many smart and effective people is that it can be difficult to recognize your own value, if you're used to being the smartest guy in the room and suddenly you're surrounded by people who are at or above your ability, that can be a bit of a blow to the ego. I eventually worked through this, but it took the better part of a year.  - Slow ramp-up: One of the drivers of impostor syndrome for me was that it took me a lot longer to find my footing and get effective here than at other jobs. Some of that is on me for not asking more questions, but I think more proactive support from leadership might have helped. The environment at Google is very unique and there's a lot to learn before an engineer can get things done.  - Living in a bubble: The perks and so on make life at Google very comfortable.

My work area was a warehouse with open ceilings, concrete floors, and metal desks arranged in groups of six people in a workspace. The interview process was generic, so that once you are approved, you go into a pool of candidates from which managers pick new hires. I only had a half-hour phone interview with my future boss before I had to decide whether to take the position. My boss never allowed me to work with anyone on a project to get me up to speed, despite numerous requests for help. He assigned me the task of writing the specs for a major modification which included several groups not in my area - a task I would not expect of anyone with less than two years experience in the division, yet he assigned it to a person with less than four months experience.

Lots of technical folks everywhere you turn.,"There is very little emphasis on customers. the majority of folks who work here are motivated by two things: better resume, and tech stuff that one ups other techies.  As a rather high ranking techie from half way across the world, these folks are not at all what I expected in terms of caliber. Communication, people management, keeping a cool head, these things are not common here, and if you have them, they are not appreciated here.  This place is a mecca for folks that can't relate to others very well, but are very technically savvy.  Before you come here there are a few things you need to know: 1) most folks come here because they want to be happy 2) aside from the common knowledge that if you are presently at (be careful of used to work at) Google then you are technically smarter than others 3) Once you leave Google, people will think it was because you couldn't cut it, not because you were amazing. the only way to go is to either A) start your own company (not very common as there is not a focus on customers) B) get poached (very common), but after you have been poached everyone will still think you couldn't cut it at the big Goog. 4) most folks are happy because of 3 things:  A) finding a mate (not very likely at Goog, unless you are hetero female, then game on, except most females here intimidate the guys... lol)  B) making money (yep, you can do that here as well, ironically they don't pay that well for the area: IE you can 3x that in IT Finance or startups, or 2X in places like netflix, not to promote netflix, but they are very interesting if you are heavily motivated by the mulah)  C) making a difference in the world (not super common here)  I know a lot of people who are only happy when talking to other people about their career because they work at Goog, but have pretty much put their life on hold, and their happiness on hold to be here.  Honestly, only work here if you live here. Do not travel to work at Google. It doesn't work out, and everyone ends up leaving to find a mate, more money, Do not move away from family to be here.  Basically work here if you have no other options. If your people skills or business skills are to weak to affect folks, and you are OK not finding anyone special for a few years, and you are OK with really long hours, work here. It is hella good bragging rights to most folks, but once you get high enough in the tech world, it can be a negative.  Actually I should share this as well. the best people at google get poached (startups, other tech companies, etc...) the worst get canned all the people who can fake it stay the people that stay hire other people just like them There are a sea of shitty people growing at Google, beware them, and if one of them is your manager, transfer or leave ASAP, lest you find out the #1 factor of job unhappiness. =)  All in all, if you live in the area, and are just starting your career, please dont let this scare you.

I've seen amazing rates of burnout among marketing. Too much. Also, middle management can be incompetent or too busy racing to the top to care about you.

I joined Google about a year ago after many years in mid-tier management consulting. For me, it's been a refreshing return to work-life balance. No, that doesn't mean I work 35 hr weeks. I'm often at Google before 7am and sometimes stay past 7pm. I work hard because I want to be the best in my profession, because I believe I should earn all those perks Google is famous for, and because my team, who want to be the best in their professions, are relying on me.  That said, I've never worked into the wee hours of the morning. Every Saturday and Sunday you'll find me outside running or biking, not in the office. I have a wonderful marriage, get 8 hrs sleep every night and am fortunate to be leaving a happy life.  In contrast, my consulting career was full of 70 hr workweeks, travel away from my family, unbelievable levels of stress and piles of politics. Maybe Google is also like this at the VP and SVP level, I'm not sure. But I'm about half way up the so-called corporate ladder and, at least from my perspective, things are refreshingly balanced and authentic. Again, I'm only 1 year in so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt.  The other myth I'd like to debunk (actually, it appears to already be long-before debunked) is that only ivy-grads can get into Google. From what I've heard, this was more true 10 years ago. But, I attended a small undergrad school you've probably never heard of and haven't been back to school since. I think what Google is looking for is the same as any company: people with honest passion for their trade, who don't mind putting in some elbow grease to keep the company growing.","Let's be honest: Google spoils it's employees. We're all fortunate to work here. The thing I worry about most is whether I'm making a real difference. Google has such a legacy, and such infinite resources, that it can be a little overwhelming trying to figure out if you're taking full advantage of the opportunity. For example, I'm guessing that the job posting that started my career here had maybe 100 other applicants. That's 100 people who could have done a better job if I feel like ""taking it easy"" today. I worry about doing well enough here to continue he legacy built before me.",Larry does a great job as far as I can tell.

Maybe it varies somewhat by team, but from my vantage point, engineering seemed very bloated and bureaucratic. There is an obscenely long and restrictive ""style guide"" of programming rules that must be followed and company-wide banned language features that makes coding much less productive than I'm used to. Code reviews sometimes become bickerfests and can drag on for weeks or months. The allocation of engineers to teams is awful - my recruiter basically lied about what I would be working on, when I arrived I was assigned to a team and project that I had no interest in whatsoever, and there was nothing I could do about it except suck it up until I could leave. My coworkers were extremely risk-averse and were far more concerned about breaking something that already worked than about making progress. Also the culture is biased towards ""perfect"" engineering solutions, and just hacking to get something done is highly frowned upon. This isn't always bad, and you can learn good programming practices and discipline, but unfortunately it just isn't always practical in the real world of deadlines and needing to make progress.  The worst part of all is that I never felt like my work mattered anyway to the success of the company. I worked on various projects that my manager assigned (there wasn't much discretion in choosing things to work on, and the vaunted 20% time is just hype), and my manager had a lot of ""pet projects"" that he wanted done but didn't really have any great justification for why they should be done at all.  Anyway Google is a big company and managers and teams vary in quality. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are much happier than me, but I also think my situation is hardly unique.","Don't assign engineers to projects before their start date and assume that the employee will be happy with whatever crappy project they are assigned to.

I mean they give explicit instructions for calibration and promo to consider only demonstrable benefits of the last 6 months of work, and nothing earlier than that which had a delayed benefit. So the rank and file are forced to be like shitty mutual fund managers obsessed with quarterly results, in contrast to the upper management's supposed long term focus.  When you start they flip a coin and if it comes up tails you are stuck in ads for years against your will.  20% time is a lie. 20% time is essentially unpaid overtime and if god forbid your 20% time takes a risk and fails you will be calibrated as if you had spent that time doing nothing.  Every creative idea is shot down in favor of the same old safe but inefficient crap. All the projects come from the top down. There is no bottom-up innovation in ads because they try to keep everyone 110% busy with top down mandates. The company hasn't really innovated much in years. All their fast growing products are acquisitions or ""me too"" and the ads infrastructure is bloated and ossified.  There's a lot of witness-tampering when it comes to peer reviews and stack ranks. You aren't allowed to rate your experience working with a person. You're supposed to somehow rate their entire accomplishment including stuff that you had nothing to do with. And if your stack ranks differ greatly from your manager's opinion of the latter they will passive aggressively hint that it will be a reason for firing you.  Valve has a much better stack ranking system where people just rate their own experience working with a person and all feedback is anonymous. Also unlike Valve, Google has no freedom of association with whatever projects you want to do. It's all top-down mandates and selfish horse-trading by psychopathic middle managers.  I've read about the toxic culture that killed Microsoft and it sounds very similar to Google in my experience.

4264,4265,google,"San Francisco, CA"," Feb 28, 2013",Current Employee - Software Engineer,"Meaningless work, hypocrisy, politics, bureaucracy, great pay and benefits.","In my experience, Google is an awesome place to work if: - you get intrinsic enjoyment from writing code - even when asked to spend months coding something for reasons that are unclear or less than inspiring (like lack of planning, inter-group politics, inertia, etc.) - you like reading code, doing code reviews, and having access to the entire source code of most google products. - you plan to work here for at least several years and like the idea of spending your first 3 to 6 months getting familiar with the large number of google-only systems, tools, libraries and coding practices that must be known even before doing small internal projects - even though this knowledge will be mostly irrelevant outside of google. - if forced to choose, you would prefer a high salary, incredible benefits and job stability more than working on projects you care about.  There are relatively few Pros that survived my first 2 months here and that I'll miss when I leave. These are: - you are surrounded by smart, interesting people many of whom are new to the area and looking to make friends. - some really awesome internally-built tools for writing code, doing code reviews, building dashboards, etc.","Disclaimer: Google is the most decentralized company I've worked for in the degree to which different groups and projects have their own work intensity, culture, ambitiousness, manager quality, etc. A lot of people I know love working here, feel they are working on interesting/important projects, and are full of respect for their colleagues and leadership.  My experience, unfortunately, has been almost entirely negative: - problems start with the hiring process because they put up vaguely described job openings, don't tell you almost anything about what you'll be working on during the interview, and then don't make any attempt to match you to projects you might care about or have experience with. The implied message is - you made it to Google, so you're smart enough to learn new technology, languages, and skills as needed, and we give you so much that you should be happy working on anything. After working here for several months, my impression was: - self-satisfaction, detachment/cluelessness/apathy and arrogance are prevalent including at the very top. - too many of the company's core slogans frequently don't reflect reality:     - treating employees with respect - actually condescension disguised as benevolence     - caring about users - actually often dismissing them as a nuisance or too stupid to use the product correctly.     - setting goals that are so ambitious that you fail on some - actually often failing on un-ambitious goals for non-respectable reasons     - openness in communicating with employees - actually, most communications end up being empty hype and ass-kissing.     - maximise efficiency and productivity - actually, even simple web front ends requires constant battle against unrelated problems with unreasonably slow or broken internal APIs, overly slow build/test/deploy tools, lack of documentation for how to use internal systems, etc.      - fast-paced entrepreneurial culture - actually, for too many people, the main objective is to look good and score points with their manager - this is true all the way up to the VPs that report to Larry      - hire the best people - almost everybody here is really smart, but the culture often brings out the worst most unprofessional side of people       - taking risks and changing the world - level of risk I see people taking is changing the location of a UI button on an internal tool without talking to the product manager first","From what I saw while working on internal tools, it seems for too many managers, their highest aspiration is to keep employees occupied and to avoid looking bad in front of superiors. Other things besides this don't matter as much - not even user complaints (unless/until superiors start caring). Put another way, I was disappointed by the lack of idealism and purpose, by the excessive careerism and politics and by the us vs. them mentality between different engineering groups and between engineers and users.",2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,25,Software Engineer,1,2013,Feb,1,12.950999999999999,409.62,0

This can make it difficult to make a difference or even be heard outside of the org. Often, those who succeed in finance are those that can please their business partners in Engineering/Product which can cause incredible conflicts of interest (sure, that acquisition looks fabulous and it's only $100M! I can make an analysis that makes it look great ) - even if not explicit the pressure to please powerful VPs in Eng is intense. This is compounded by the hyper-reliance on 360 feedback and networking which means it can be hard to make a change or stand up if something seems wrong.  Finance is primarily full of investment bankers & consultants, with little folks with actual Corp Finance experience. This causes an amazing amount of inefficiency as folks don't understand how to do basic things like create a budget and expect people to stick to it (seriously - within weeks of budget creation no one knows if budget applies anymore or if we're moving to a monthly forecast view instead). At first, I tried very hard to get more Corp Finance folks in the org but now I actually think IBankers do best as folks with actual CF experience tend to be so shocked by the Google processes (or lack thereof) they simply cannot hang.  Work/life balance is dreadful - since the employee base is generally young and former bankers, most folks don't seem to be upset by late nights stretching past midnight but for those with families (or even those that just enjoy their lives outside of work) this can be painful. Especially since most of the time is spent on projects that go nowhere.  Google elects not to use ERP or other established software in favor of developing their own solutions. Then they don't staff these solutions with adequate Eng resources. Result is an incredible lack of data availability with the expectation that finance be ""scrappy"" to find ways to tease out or completely guess at the data. Upside is that without a data source no one's likely to know if you're completely off base - but this can be unsettling for folks who really want to use reliable info to make business decisions.  There are constant reorgs and reprioritizations at Google - particularly if you don't support the Search / Ads business. Forget about focusing on anything that will take more than 1 Q to achieve.  This is a social/extroverted environment which means that those who are good at networking have an edge over those who don't, even if the folks who don't are doing a superior job.

I have been able to pursue several distinct ""mini-careers"" at the company, with promotions and transfers available as I hit major project milestones. The career environment is ideal for someone who thrives on complexity, who takes initiative, and who communicates well and constantly with technical collaborators.  I feel that management empowers and facilitates individual contributors. You have a fantastic liberty here to challenge how things are done (whether bureaucratically, technically or in product design). Expect fast and constant change. You can step up and drive that change, too, if you have the chops -- the courage to express a coherent vision, and the stamina and depth of skill to follow through. A high impact project at Google can affect a global user base of hundreds of millions (or is it billions now?), and can shape the course and direction of whole industries. You can provide great benefit to users worldwide. The right answer to a search query can literally save a life, reorient a career, or enrich a relationship. And while search is critically important, we do so much more.  When it works, it is a total jazz. When it doesn't work, well, you fail fast and try something new. Everyone outside tends to ask, ""What company will be the next Google?"", but internally we remain quite ambitious: ""My project at Google will be the next Google!""  The people here are great to work with. Passionate about ideas, compassionate toward others, with many innovative superstars, and a culture that celebrates diversity. Of course, there is some politics, human nature and fallibility -- as you will find anywhere -- but I find the overall environment positive and well intentioned.","Working at Google has a stiff learning curve, and it can be challenging to ramp up and get your footing here -- especially if you have been doing software development 10+ years elsewhere and are accustomed to being a big fish. In you aren't on a very short list of luminaries (e.g. a Vint Cerf), then respect and influence have to be re-earned from scratch based on what you do at the company. Your past merits may have helped you get in the door, but inside they buy you nothing. So, to thrive here you have to grow and sustain some inspiration about what's possible, to keep your head above the daily grind of routine work.  Working at Google can isolate you from the global technology community, as well as sometimes from our users. We have our own technology stack and internal lingo, so systems and methods learned here aren't always transferable. We exist in an extreme media spotlight, in highly competitive markets, dealing with sensitive information, so we are very cautious about sharing anything externally. The culture tends to be inward facing: everything is on campus (the Googleplex) -- meals, entertainment, perk, education, tech talks -- so why engage outside of the bubble? Our approach is to solve everything with automation so that the system works on a global scale, but human-to-human customer service does not ""scale"", and so is sometimes given short shrift.","I find that Google's leadership is willing to make hard choices with integrity. They are an inspiration -- and they are always challenging us to reach further, try harder, think more deeply.",5.0,4.5,3.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,9,Senior Staff Engineer,1,2010,Jun,2,6.82,241.25,1

I was too...at least for the beginning of two months. So, I don't need to repeat the good things about working for Google here. But, remember, all the good things are mostly posted by ""software engineers"". They are like king of the world in Google versus operation engineers (including me) are like slavers of the king.","Google, fortunately, is the worst company I have ever worked for. It attracts so many talent people to work for this company, but in fact, the only give software engineers the special treatment. I've seen so many great engineers in operation team were treated like nothing.  1. management sucks My manager is the root cause that every engineer suffers. He is the best politician I have ever seen in my life. Ever since he promoted to be a manager, he started to play all the dirty games among us. He spent $20 mil per year on some equipments which melt down network connectivity so many times every month. He claimed that the equipments would save Google for 10 millions per year, but in fact, we spent a lot more work hours on trying to solve the problems these junks caused. The main problem is, there is no test base for these junks. Aren't we supposed to test all the equipment before we implement or even purchase them? Not these junks... how does it happen? pick ur guess! How about we go the manger above him. Too bad.. the upper manager is his buddy. There is no complain or any bad thing would ever leak out through these 2 layers of managers. They cover everything up very well. In fact, one of the manager's jobs should ensure the fairness. Well... ""fairness"" is NEVER been seen at this team.  2. politics tricks My manager has this policy: all the engineers under level III can not talk to the engineers above level IV. Well.... before I join google, I thought anyone could talk directly to anyone, even to CEO. But my manager fired a person who asked questions to a level IV. His recently move was - promoted two of his favorites to be managers and directly reported to him. You know what it means? He just promoted himself since there are two managers reporting to him now. That was the exact trick his upper manager did a couple years ago. Now... there are 3 levels of management under one director. How does this director allow this happen?? well.. that's the politics. So, when the new engineer join the team, how many levels above him?? It's IMPOSSIBLE that you get promoted if there is one new layer added. Most likely, you got downgraded every year!!  3. STEALING/CHEATING I've never seen so many cheating cases ever since I graduated from college, but here, at Google. We have two level IV engineers responsible for designing networks with one stealing ideas/credits from the other one's work!! And this cheating is permitted by the upper manager!! How did it happen? well... the managers playing the games. The two (now three) levels managers ensures that none of outside team could work with the talent engineer alone. When they steals, those seniors all lined up and the upper manager would give pressure down to turn in the design and the credits. Whoever on the same side of this level IV engineer would suffer a hard time and have bad reviews from those managers. So, we watched the stealing and cheating happening every day but no one dare to say anything.  <to be continued>","I thought Google was not a place for the politician to play games with every day.

Groups are all very autonomous, so individual engineers have a lot of control over direction of the group and responsibility for the success of the team. The company assumes you're going to be thinking about more than getting to your current milestone, and expects you to think big and aim for large goals.  I've found the other engineers sharper and more accomplished than anywhere else, everyone has shipped great things before, and they're eager to do it again. It's not surprising to be working with a 24 year old who sold a company, two senior engineers who were VPs at startups, and a well-known researcher in a particular area.","It's a cross between grad school and a hundred little startups. I haven't always gotten guidance from management about what's important or how the teams need to work together. Like grad school, there's times where it does feel all your responsibility. Marketing and bigger vision sometimes comes from the product managers, but it always feels like individual advice rather than a single clear vision of where we should go.  Individual teams have a lot of control over libraries and code they use, so lots of infrastructure projects grow as research projects that succeed only if adopted by significant numbers of other teams.  Although there is a big vision for the company, it isn't as focused or controlled as in other companies, there's really an assumption that the right stuff will bubble up. It's not a place with the razor-focused direction.  Initial titles/ranks and promotions are determined by committees of other engineers. This is great because you're recognized for your engineering work, but bad if you aren't churning out enough code or if you're not having enough impact on the rest of the company. Initial titles get assigned 6-12 months in when you're put in the same pool as existing Googlers who are up for promotion. If you don't match up to them, you go down a slot - no difference in salary, bonuses based on new level, and any mental scars from being judged unworthy. It doesn't really matter, but if you're at Google you're probably not used to failing.  Everyone's driven to succeed. There may not be a lot of external pressure from management to pull long hours, but folks tend to do it anyway because they want to accomplish something great. It's an easy place to feel you're below average, even when you've been tops everywhere else.","Keep helping us focus on the vision of what we need to accomplish.

My manager never once created an annual or quarterly strategic business plan. He (actually *I*) filled in the template given by management, but he never created a plan we could work toward. As a result, people did what they wanted, which was not always most profitable (in part because short term incentives don't align with long term profitability). This created a lot of problems. In 2007, the company created a new layer of middle-manager jobs and hired people internally...without training them to be managers! Disaster. Lots of inefficiency and broken promises. Horrible decision that continues to plague employees. There are some good managers, I just didn't work with any. -No career development. Minimal worthwhile training. You can take a course here and there, but when it comes to moving around the company, watch out. Sales, Engineering, and Enterprise are silos---you can't move between them. *Everyone* complains about this. Smart people have for years been talking about leaving. -They fired most of HR in 2009 (the others have always been contract workers without benefits), what remains of HR is really weak. HR is never helpful anyway. -No one ""owns"" decisions (not even managers or their managers!), but everyone gets a say...so few risks get taken and greatness rarely evolves beyond the idea stage -There's a lot of mediocrity, why improve when improvement might require you or teammates to work a little smarter or harder? Lots of resistance to change that requires more work. -Flat organization is bad for people whose work shows skill beyond job level / area & typical promotion cycles (senior management encouraged national sales team to think of lateral moves as promotions...even though you don't make more money, get better titles--and then must start the promotion journey afresh as if you had never worked there before) -Salary. When Google offered me the job, a well-known, respected web property with a similar job did as well. The latter offered me TWICE as much money as Google. Twice! And all the good benefits. -Salary increases over time. When you're promoted, you don't make all that much more. Bonuses are small (and taxed at 50%). Options are not worth as much as you think. And you don't get as much stock as you think, either. (These are taxed at 50%, too, so you don't really get very much!)  All of this relates to the non-engineering side. I always really liked the engineers and when I worked with their projects found great synergies. Unfortunate the sales side made it so hard to move over!","Teams need better direction. Many managers are very poor leaders who don't make decisions or set clear goals or make teammates accountable to those goals. Just letting everyone do their own thing is a problem...especially when multiple positions have to support multiple people whose own agendas create conflicts of interest (and inefficiencies and tension). You need to give stars more opportunity to grow, they need more than just new projects. You need to actually develop these people. You know that salespeople are not the only stars or potential future leaders. You need to reward and grow more than just the salespeople. Because, let's be honest, many of the salespeople are not the ones growing the revenue. They get the credit, but in the end you lose some of the people most responsible.

Everybody you meet at Google will have been the best, most talented person at their previous organization. Somehow, Google has managed to preserve an open culture where people really aren't arrogant. I don't know where this ""arrogant Google engineer"" stereotype came from, because this is about as far from the truth as it gets. You will learn so many secrets it will blow your mind. The tools you have available are mind blowing. You get to dogfood and have your applications dogfooded internally long before they are released.  20% time exists! In reality it's never as sexy as working on Gmail, but if you have a passion, say, writing a MySQL client in Go, the new language Google released, go for it.  Google engineers can take time to attend classes to improve themselves. Google invests a lot of money in career development for their employees.  There's too much good stuff going on at Google to put down. I'm sure some of the other reviews will cover them.","It could suck for you if you are not a developer. If you are a developer, you never have to worry about things like squeezing out money from your products, but if you're anyone else the pressure is constantly on.  The Mountain View office has the best vibe, and this vibe is missing from the other offices.  Honestly, I don't care about this one but not all the fringe perks are as good as the media makes it out to be. Massages aren't free, you have to earn credits. You get one a year on your birthday and these are often given out as prizes for internal contests. Dry cleaning isn't free. Etc.  You will be too busy to take advantage of all the perks.  Base compensation is not great, but Google rarely lays people off. Google hires people that want to do a good job, so this isn't a place where if you have a bad quarter you are gone. You simply may be passed up for bonus, which will suck.",More strongly encourage mixing between groups.

It’s not the best setting for strong and independent engineers to focus and develop solid code. There are such engineers in our office that hardly able to focus and be quiet for more than 30 minutes, always talk loud and flatter each other. I am annoyed and disturbed on an hourly basis.  Project management: poor project management, lack of discipline and launch schedule. It’s very hard to estimate what and by when project will be launched. There is no one to enforce some discipline on code quality and stability. Launch delay quarter after quarter. When accountability finally comes and the project risks of being canceled, I see desperate launch push and poor code quality.  Manager role: Managers and directors usually stay far away from daily project management duties. Manager does not know what individual software engineer is doing so don’t slightly expect such otherwise you will be disappointed. Majority managers are not technically strong and write zero or negligible code. Don’t expect much technical inspirations or lead by example from your manager. You will neither see much career mentoring nor other “soft” help from the manager. I had 1:1 with my previous manager maybe 3~4 times during the whole year period. Despite being the “manager” of our project, all his involvement was showing up a few times in our project meeting and later claims making big impact to the project on his self performance evaluation.  Career growth: Despite the peer review model, the manager’s feedbacks appear to be what really matter. People that are vocal and suck up to their managers are very more likely to be promoted. If you are hard-working engineer that is able to and like to solve hard problems independently without making superficial noises, and expect Google to recognize your contributions, you will be very disappointed. I know some of such solid and senior engineers, about half of them already let Google. This is very counter-intuitive given the perception people have about Google.  Project and team: Google is primarily an advertisement (instead of technology) company. The web search infrastructure is awesome however only need a relatively small number of people work on that. The available projects for most people, especially in satellite offices, are limited and not technically hard-core. If you are a senior and talented engineer, you may not find a local project that allows you to focus and solve hard challenging technical problems. It also becomes harder to find other senior talented engineers that you respect and love to work on, given senior engineers are leaving and junior engineers are joining.  Engineering quality: I am disappointed with the code quality of my current team. Despite Google’s code review standard and practices, too many times people hastily touch existing code or add hacky code with no real testing. Such code checked in and deployed to data center. Overall it requires a lot more unnecessary iterations and bug fixes to stabilize the system. I don’t mind working 60 hours per week at all but it is frustrated to see most time wasted dealing with silly buggy integrated system.

4740,4741,google,"Mountain View, CA"," Jan 3, 2009",Current Employee - Technical Writer,The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture.,"The very best reason to work at Google can be summed up in one word: culture. Since that is a rather vague term, let me elaborate. Google has established and continues to nurture a culture that fosters, high levels of both work satisfaction and contribution from its employees. It does this by recognizing the potential in all employees via established work policies, rather than just through lip service, like many companies. Following are some concrete examples of this:  Promotion and work performances is entirely reliant on peer reviews. In other words, to get ahead at Google and to get a positive performance review, you must get positive reviews from your fellow co-workers. Your manager might love you, but if your co-workers don't like you, you have some work to do. Managers are also required to seek peer review from those they manage. (I have never seen this before in my career.) Senior level employees from other fields are also encouraged to seek peer reviews from people in other departments. For example, engineers need reviews from people other than engineers in order to advance. For this reason, a culture of cooperation is endemic at Google. This is great because the percentage of ""cowboys"" that seems common at other high tech companies is quite low at Google. It also fosters an awareness of the type of contribution made by people outside your department, since everyone reviews people in other fields, and therefore must learn a bit about what others do outside their sphere.  Career tracks fall into either management or individual contributor. This is great for people who might want to try management but later decide that they perform best as an individual contributor, or who just want to take a break from management for a while. In addition, it's not too difficult to switch between tracks. Finally, managers and team leads are also encouraged to solicit leadership-level contribution from the reportees, as a way to encourage career growth and to share the load, so to speak. This whole mechanism results in a very strong sense of independence and high-level of function from everyone, because if there is a problem that you think should be fixed, you can fix it and get genuine recognition for it, both from peers and managers.  You are required to keep a work log, as a means for you to accurately report on your contributions and as a source for your own assessment and of others' assessment of you. In addition, there are other assessment tools that are big part of Google work life, designed to keep you mindful of your work contribution and to help you and others write performance reviews. This sort of sounds tough, but the end result is that you can work to your best and not have to worry about mis-perceptions of your performance: you've written it down. Additionally, if you are spending a LOT of time working on tasks not related to your main project, your log is a way for you to work with your manager in order to change unnecessary demands on your time. I would say that this practice exemplifies one portion of the transparency that is so pervasive at Google.  Ideas and contributions from employees are highly encouraged. This results in some great products for the company, like AdWords, which was an idea from an early Google engineer, and Gmail, which was a 20% project. Googlers also gain a lot of company and community recognition for extra efforts/contributions that they feel passionate about, and this only adds to the environment for everyone. As another example, some employees at Google Mountain View worked hard to create alternative means of fresh drinking water for employees, rather than having the company stock water bottles (which contribute tremendously to landfill waste). This was a big effort. Now we have filtered water stations all over the place--it's not directly tied to ""search"" but it contributed to the company mission to ""do no evil"" and it added to the green image of the company.  I could go on and on about culture at Google, and I've only scratched the surface, but hopefullly this conveys a sense of what I mean by ""culture"" at Google and how important this element is to a great working environment.","From my four years of working at Google, I've seen the following downsides:  * In sales, management level employees tended to be hired from MBA programs rather than be promoted from within. I was not personally affected by this practice, but I witnessed the demoralizing effect this had on a good number of very high performers who would have benefitted from a performance-education program so that their level of effort and seniority would have been recognized. In addition, as is almost always the case from hiring outside management, there was a great deal of frustration from employees because the manager was completely unfamiliar with the culture and process at Google, and this resulted in a feeling of being managed by someone who learned management at Harvard or Yale.  * Google ""over-hires"" people. By this, I mean that Google regularly staffs highly-qualified people in positions that are not suited to their level of education. So, for example, you would see software engineers being hired by support. That's just stupid. I appreciate the high standards that Google has for its employees, but I genuinely think they tend to over-correct in that regard, and this results in people not really being suited for the position into which they are hired. Sometimes it's possible for such people to migrate to other positions within the company to which they are better suited, but often this results in a level of frustration... mostly in this case people find work elsewhere, but in the mean time, this very necessary position must be filled by another hire, which then must also be trained. Not efficient, and not effective. Google also tends to focus hiring assessment on academic scores, which is entirely appropriate for new grads, but they do this even for people with multiple years in the field. That's just silly, and it actually does run contrary to the whole performance process within the company itself, where effort and accomplishments are recognized. Thus, it makes no sense to disregard this type of assessment for new hires whose professional contribution can far outweigh their academic performance by many years.  * Google encourages employee contribution to so many different projects that it is difficult for someone to get ""deep"" into a particular project and focus entirely on that effort. In this, I am speaking from my own personal experience. I feel that volume of contribution is valued at times over quality or depth of contribution. There is a sort of ""check list"" mentality where, the more bullet items you can point to, the more you are seen as a strong contributor. I think there should be more attention paid to contribution to items that are complex in nature and require more focused attention. for me, it's just frustrating, because I cannot live up to my own level of quality in my main project because of other demands from other projects.","See my three downsides: look to hire from within, recognize significant career experience from new hires over academic, and consider the need for ""focus"" on particular projects.",5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,12,Technical Writer,1,2009,Jan,1,5.5089999999999995,196.71,1

Google is deteriorating at the edges. Many managers at Google got their jobs just by having low employee numbers and are otherwise unqualified. Once entrenched they tend to show little concern for their reports, concerning themselves with ""managing up"" to their own manager. Google is supposed to have a project matrix where tech leads are peers, not managers, but managers commonly flout this and micromanaging is endemic. Moving between projects is limited by complex procedures and is rarely attempted. In satellite offices the selection of projects to work on is limited and to make matters worse it is discouraged for engineers to work on projects not centered in their own offices. Being friends with your manager is a more effective way to get promoted than showing competence. In fact, showing too much competence or initiative is a good way to earn the ire of your manager. Performance evaluation is supposed to be by peer review but in reality, feedback from peers is ignored and only the manager's rating is taken seriously. Political infighting and character assassination are increasingly the norm at Google. Managers turn a blind eye to it, perhaps because they have found such techniques useful in developing their own careers. Google base compensation is on the low side, and is supposed to be more than made up for by incentive bonuses, but these are largely illusionary because few employees receive the necessary ""exceeds expectations"" performance evaluation. Managers at Google tend to consider themselves special people, better than engineers. Few will bother to greet or otherwise acknowledge the existence of anybody other than another manager if they pass them in the hall. Except for the weekly TGIF cross-company sessions where the founders candidly answer questions from all employees, management at Google is increasingly secretive about procedures and plans.","Google engineers tend to be first rate but managed by unqualified, self-obsessed managers who were promoted into their positions just by being in the right place at the right time.

You'll make up for it in bonus and the cost of not having to buy breakfast and lunch. You won't get the bonus if you're on leave (i.e., medical leave, maternity leave, etc) so you'll end up getting a lower slice of your total compensation than you might at some companies that provide a higher base salary.  There is huge variation among managers in the sales organization. Some have no experience managing people, some have experience but still aren't good managers, and some are great.

It doesn't matter what your degree is in or how long you've been at the company -- if you get stuff done and do it well you'll be treated well. And, of course, the coworkers are luminaries, but they tend (in my experience) to be accepting of newcomers without the same background. I've had no trouble digging my fingers into topics from machine learning to the Java virtual machine, learning all the while. The company has some communication silos due to its size, but the walls aren't solid -- I routinely hack on other peoples' code, and they hack back. It's all very open.  They really pull out all the stops to make sure engineers can do their job, whether you need a second workstation, a thousand more machines in a datacenter, or scones. Information flow within the company is still quite free, particularly compared to Microsoft or Apple.  Managers I've interacted with are sharp and encourage good work-life balance, reminding employees to take time off and guarding against burnout. My managers have constantly communicated their expectations and our performance, and have actively worked to help me in my career development and promotions -- or, when a project slips off track, to understand why and help.  And, finally, I think Google's pay is pretty darn good. Microsoft recruiters assure me that it's 30% lower, but I've got friends at MS and those numbers just don't add up. This site should do a good job showing the true situation (and the resulting competition will help us all!).","You are expected to deliver. This doesn't mean 80-hour work weeks (at least in my end of the company), but you are expected to make goals and hold yourself to them -- and ideally deliver something that beats the rest of the industry while you're at it. Do not come to Google expecting a research environment, there's plenty of research going on, but if it's not in your 20% time you'd better have something to ship. I list this as a con only because I suspect this bit some of the people who rated Google negatively.  The company has grown really fast. This has caused some strain, both in terms of infrastructure and in communication. Many of the nooglers are fresh out of college, and the naivety cuts both ways: they're simultaneously over-eager to re-engineer everything in sight, and bitter when perks change or they don't get promoted fast (nevermind that it's still better than the rest of the industry -- they've never been there). With rapid growth comes a lack of focus, as well, with weird projects with no monetization story. (Caveat: I'm in Ads, where money matters.)  I get the impression that we've got our share of bad managers. My manager (and the two immediately above him) are all great -- technically sharp, caring, and happy to get their hands dirty. But I've heard horror stories from other teams, and you can read plenty of them on this site, I'm sure -- preference for low employee numbers, suckups and yes-men, etc. I suspect most of the thoroughly bitter people have gotten a bad manager and not requested a transfer out from under him/her.  On that note, Google does a bad job of handling underperformers. They try hard to help crappy engineers and managers improve, but at some point you've got to cut your losses -- a bad employee, particularly one with a bad attitude, is poison that eats away at morale. I've seen people go through two or more performance improvement plans before finally getting the much-needed axe.  Google also does a fair-to-middling job of handling *overperformers*. I've gotten a few spot bonuses for successful projects (which, to be fair, were tens of times larger than the bonuses I got at similarly-sized companies in the past), but the motivating effect of the Founder's Awards are gone. No matter how many millions of dollars you make the company, if you're not in LSE's pet segments, no Founder's Award for you -- it'll go to some guys in search or something. Google is done making millionaires -- for those of us who got who got here after the IPO, the only way we'll retire is a 401(k). Again, having worked in industry outside of Google, this makes me wistful but not angry. I don't expect other people to make me a millionare.

Google treats its employees very well and believes in leadership from the bottom up, which provides a sense of ownership and personal investment that is unequaled in my experience. Google employees are encouraged to treat each other as respected equals, no matter what the difference in job title might be. Google also encourages the notion that good ideas can come from anywhere, and that the best ideas rarely come from management.  Perhaps most importantly, Google is one of the only places in the world where you can work on products that could potentially be used by hundreds of millions of people. It's very satisfying to share your work with family and friends, and to see people using your products nearly every day.","The larger the company gets, the more the culture becomes dilute. The past year or two has brought extensive change in terms of management hierarchy to certain area of the company. With the hiring or more and more managers from the outside, the company has lost some of its democratic idealism in favor of traditional corporate politics. Google is now a very large company, and it's hard to avoid all of the downsides that accompany such size.  It can also be very difficult to find a career path at Google. Promotions are exceptionally rare. Despite the fact that employees can theoretically excel in both individual contributor and management tracks, there is still a feeling that the only way to climb the corporate ladder is to become a manager. It's also the case that people are often promoted into management roles without the necessary skills and training, leading to poor relationships between teams and leaders.  It also becomes more and more difficult to make fast progress on projects as the company gets larger. Google is still very nimble compared to most large companies, but it's no longer a scrappy startup unencumbered by size.","Google needs to pay more attention to its middle management.

4905,4906,google,"Mountain View, CA"," May 5, 2008",Former Employee - Risk Analyst,Google:An Elitist's Playground,"When people think of working for Google, the food and facilities are generally what come to mind first…and those are the best parts. Google fosters a college or academic feel where you never need to leave the campus in order to find sustenance or a respite from the daily grind. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are offered Monday through Friday, and the food is pretty good (keep in mind I'm comparing it to other free food…so how can you really complain?). Google-colored Swiss balls (those bouncy orbs you see freakishly fit people doing sit-ups on in infomercials) invade the office cubicles and give the workspace a much more play-pen sort of feel. To bolster the dorm room ambiance, Google also supplies pinball machines, foosball, ping pong & pool tables, and assorted video games. Foam darts are passed out for 'dart wars' during especially hectic times, and silently encourage the employees to roll away from their ergonomically arranged desks to fling projectiles at unsuspecting coworkers. After a grueling week of work, an employee can look forward to a company-funded bender in the form of microbrew beer (both on tap and in bottles!), wine, and the occasional Jell-O shot. If the alcohol upsets your stomach and a retreat to a bathroom is what you crave, fear not! In addition to having showers in almost every building, Google boasts toilets with heated seats, built-in bidets, and dryers for those who prefer to relieve themselves in a more ""green"" fashion.","If you enjoy your individuality and time alone, Google is not the place for you (keep in mind I’m not an engineer). Google pushes a highly ""googley"" atmosphere, which is something akin to what the Brady Bunch would be like if they lived in communist Russia. Everything from the carpet to the bathroom tiles incorporate the Google colors into its design. People are encouraged to have googley attitudes, wear plastic smiles, and not to question the infallible nature of the executive management group. Marathon hours are the standard because, after all, employees are practically encouraged to bring a cot and sleep there…barracks coming soon (really?! no, not really). If you like feeling awkward during forced group activity, Google is your haven. It isn't exactly ""forced"" (no guns), but if you don't participate you become labeled as ""ungoogley."" Once deemed “ungoogley”, you're practically viewed as a rotten apple that threatens to spoil the bunch. If you can endure and appreciate the googley atmosphere, you might also enjoy Google's uncanny ability to clot information within the hierarchy. Very little is shared throughout the company because from the moment you're hired, secrecy is revered. But to be honest, most of those who read this review won't even be able to get a job there. Whether you're right out of college or are putting your kids through college, your academic standing will be asked about, your transcripts required. If you went to Podunk U, your chances are worse than the rumored 1% of applicants.

The claimed corporate culture of openness, a flat organisational structure and acceptance of employees’ true selves is a good ideology, though clearly sometimes a failed practice.","Google management are surprisingly penny pinching in allocating sufficient resource to projects by way of staff, office space, and budget. Success here depends on how good your boss is at politicking and how good you are at politicking with your boss, rather than actually being focused on the merits of specific investments - the scale is too large to be accurate when it comes to brass tacks.  I’d rather go without free food and have the resource I need to do my job without working the 60-70 hour work weeks, and the constant travel demanded of me because we don’t have enough staff in Europe. Approvals processes are a broken, inefficient bureaucratic grind that results in nothing but pain.  Blindly and unacceptably American-centric in product execution and in how they devalue remote staff in comparison to those who are willing to immigrate to Mountain View, CA. Titles and salary are both enormously deflated outside of California, while working hours are much longer to accommodate Googlers in HQ who don’t start their work days until 9:30/10:00 after getting in on the Google buses. Add on to that the fact that there is a systematic devaluation of non-engineering roles, and the overall picture turns pretty grim if you’re on the business side of things and outside of the US.  Recent revelations in the public eye surrounding how Google has handled sexual harassment were enormously discouraging and deflating. Before I’d been able to forgive Google a lot of its operational/administrative sins because I thought it was good at heart. Now I fear that there is something rotten in the core of Google’s management and infrastructure and I am not sure I can trust the leadership.","I’m not even sure where to begin, other than to say that you are doing an enormous disservice to your talent outside of the US. Alternative methods of evaluating salary banding other than repeating methods which work at the scale of Mountain View/SFO, but crumble when applied to smaller markets should be adopted. E.g. when you’re hiring for projects which exist at an intersection with non-tech industries, include market data from those industries. Also do a dispassionate evaluation of your job levelling which is sensitive to the extra demands placed on employees in smaller numbers outside of the core project teams in the US.

Sometimes it's easier to stick your head in the sand and get stuff done. Working in a remote office is frustrating as projects are constantly shifted back to HQ or deprioritised every 1-2 years, and almost all the senior people are in Mountain View so your impact is less visible unless you travel a lot. It's hard not being in control of your own destiny. If you are ambitious, you should move to Mountain View.

Experience how a huge company with thousands of engineers provides internal tool to cater for the corporate needs.,"A lot of lip-service to work-life balance, but in practice the way performance is gauged (along with short-staffed teams) causes people to put in long hours and be available even late at night. People leave/switch teams after just 1 year of tenure, teams and management are still stuck on their way to do things from before Google acquired them. This causes unhealthy practices (which are supposedly absent from larger Google) like stack-ranking to still be used. The compensation is not that good, considering that they'll try to hire you at a lower level compared to your prior experience. Some of the perks are also weakened or made useless: attending external conferences can be expensed only for 1/3rd of the cost of the ticket, or 2/3rd of cost of the ticket only if approved by the manager (which in my experience is never granted, unlike what happens with Google's competitors), otherwise you'll also have to use your days off to be able to attend the conference (putting some severe disincentives for you to attend).

Executives use vague CYA communication style. To me it's like hearing politicians talk. Transparency has been steadily going down for years, you hear about projects when they're announced or leaked. - Several high-level execs seem to have a pretty weak ethical compass. Increasing number of ethical scandals, antitrust fines, etc. Internal explanation often weak and unconvincing around these issues. - Lots of talk of being data driven but what's common is data being used to justify whatever fits data slinger's narrative, including for myopic goal setting that results in adverse second and third order effects (see Goodhart's law). - Increasing attitude of engineers just doing whatever they're told, forget the ""do the right thing"" of old times. - Project and product churn. Google products are often unfinished and buggy, UIs changing all the time. Lots of talk of rewarding product excellence but lots of cynicism about it (I don't buy it, I don't see the products getting better). Product managers compete to launch features, engineers have increasingly less power to make product decisions. - If you're more senior you might get pushed to do management, the old days of having a technical individual career option seems over in many teams, at least if you want to get promoted. - Internal frameworks tend to be overengineered and complex because of many disparate use cases and legacy, easy things take a long time as a result. Critical internal tools can be unstaffed while projects that go nowhere (how many chat apps?) can have massive headcount. - Crowded noisy open floor offices, with little privacy. I heard some folks outside engineering don't even get a fixed desk anymore. - AI seems much more important than privacy. Products and strategy seem aligned with getting Google more and more data. Privacy unfriendly defaults, UIs, etc. Might make you uncomfortable if you work on a consumer product.",none,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,0,Software Engineer,1,2018,Sep,3,33.74,1076.77,0

You can learn relevant product knowledge if you want to bootstrap something later on.","- Promotions solely based on something they like to call VISIBILITY. Useless projects get started all the time just to be cc'd on emails to Director-level and above. Those projects in most cases lead to nothing and don't produce ANY results at all, it is solely done for the purpose of being able to mention one's ""great"" initiative in the next performance review cycle. Another factor they promote on are several ""soft attributes"" which is a way for management to promote on subjectivity. - You are always told the company is a meritocracy eventho it is clearly not. This incongruent messaging compared to reality is extremely frustrating. It does not matter at all if you reach 100% of your target or 200%, what matters in the end is the above mentioned visibility. Another proof is that I heard managers say ""Oh, he has been here already for 2.5 years, we have to promote him now"" which is a joke and demotivating for high performing folks. - The metrics you are measured on in an Account Management role are only indirectly linked to revenue and are manipulated by the vast majority of reps once they have been on the job for a quarter and know the drill. Management knows this but does not care since they look good in front of their own bosses if the numbers look good. The best of the manipulators do not have to work at all to reach their targets. - Many of the middle managers are incompetent and have been stuck in their role for sometimes nearly a decade. There is no real willingness to achieve something great and make progress, but those people are just happy where they are in their career and spend their whole day wasting everyone's time in meetings or sending out useless emails. Very limited learning opportunity if you have a manager like this and very demotivating because no one wants to end up like them. However, there is the rare exception of a great manager. - Leadership cult, people of levels of director and above are worshipped through the entire organization and are treated like god's gift to everything. Some of them are admittedly great, some of them aren't. - Learning curve will be non-existent at the latest after 6 months and you will be doing the same day in day out. You can learn by yourself some new stuff with the great online training database, but the main thing you are doing gets old quite soon. - A lot of people drink the kool aid. There are quite a few critical people like myself in the organization, but a majority of people think they are on top of the world because they work in one of the least respected role of a prestigious company. People are not ""super smart"" everywhere, they hire basically everyone and it is just luck getting through the interview process. 90%+ of hires come from personal referrals since their CVs wouldn't go through the official channel. Level of entitled and incompetent people can be extremely high in certain teams.","Get rid of some of the terrible sales team managers. Rethink the entire system of productivity metrics (Apollo made it easier for smart people to manipulate everything, it is a complete joke and demotivating to honest reps. The idea behind it is good, but the execution couldn't have been worse, no matter how much it has been promoted as a great thing by the leadership).

For the US it has a quite good corporate culture with much individual freedom. Compared to the Nordic countries in Europe, it's about par for the course compared to startups and smaller companies.  Compensation is good, but is also geared towards keeping you at the office more (food benefits and various services etc).  Privacy concerns are taken seriously, access to personal data is, contrary to popular belief, very hard to get. You will be able to play with aggregated, anonymized data.","You're expected to work hard and much. The ""20% time for your own projects"" is a myth, more like 120% time. If you're outside the US, count on there being late night and early morning Hangout meetings with US/India several times during the weekdays.  If you're working in engineering but not as a software engineer, you will have a hard time getting good performance reviews, as all teams will value their own higher than outsiders.  Compared to other companies in more forward-thinking countries, Google is about par for the course compared to individual freedom, but you still have have the US-styled meddling micro-managing bosses.  There is great inertia in making things happen at foreign offices, things that were implemented in the US took 1-3 years to happen in Europe. If there was a tax deductable benefit that was available in your country but not in the US, it could take even longer to get it set up. The really good benefits never make it outside Mountain View.  The workplace in most offices is really crappy, the norm is small desks (hope you're not sitting opposite someone with long legs), crappy chairs, people bunched up together.  Unless you work in ads, you should be expecting your project could be shut down at any minute. If you work in ads, you'll be under pressure to make more money to the company. Even if you implement a change that increases company revenue by millions of dollars, don't expect that it will affect your bonus or salary more than an extra $10k or so - you've proven your worth, but if they pay you too much, you might leave to pursue other interests.","Pretty much all managers I met at Google seemed great at the surface, and few of them did anything really bad towards employees.

Top-down management used to be reserved for big and very strategic decisions, lately is has become the norm for small changes.  It is really a pity to see what used to be such a great environment (5+ years ago), were people used to be motivated by values, become a mediocre company, were people are motivated by fear.","Listen to the lower levels of the organization - they are the ones doing the job and know what matters. ""Flat Organization"" doesn't mean less layers, it means that lower levels (specialists) can talk freely with higher levels (directors, VPs) without being scrutinised by all the managers in the middle. Before calling you a 'leader' - understand what it means: ""Manager"" is a title given by the organization, ""leader"" is a title given by followers (if you call yourself a leader - you have already failed). Relearn to take risks - Google used to be scrappy. Spending 100+ hours creating presentations, business cases, getting buy-ins, approvals and whatnot to pilot a small project is counter productive and vey demotivating.

Given the global nature of the company, senior managers are often geographically separated from their mid-level reports, which contributes to a lack of strong mentorship and development of individuals. Corporate culture is now firmly entrenched. This is not a cool, funky start-up. Competition is fierce at the higher levels and there is the usual smattering of office politics and promotion hungry execs pushing their teams to meet their targets and protecting their empires. People seem to be hired at a level lower than they would probably occupy in another company and salaries are not that competitive - they will offer you as little as they can get away with so do not be afraid to negotiate - it does work.","Put mentorship, coaching and development of your staff and really implement it as a permanent change to the company, don't just run another 'GoogleGeist initiative' that slowly fades away over time.",3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,12,Anonymous Employee,1,2016,Jan,1,20.257,693.01,0

Huge infrastructure for experimenting. Memegen.,"Cult of growth. Everything is measured, quantified and evaluated in terms of growth and impact. Exponential growth is expected in every single metric: number of projects, number of users, lines of code, impact, whatever. If something stops growing, it usually gets killed. Do you remember Google Reader? It stopped growing. Look out for your own stats, and get transferred quickly if you stop growing at your current place.  Lack of focus. Hyperactive and very disruptive development in most areas, with user experience neglected. It is starting to hit back (as of 2014-2015). Unfortunately, I can't go into details on the consequences of this one, due to confidentiality.  Chaos. There is no stable point, everything changes all the time. All documentation is unfinished and/or outdated. Very few people have the 'big picture' and they don't have time to share it, because they have to chase their own growth. Reorganization is continually happening. People come and go, teams come and go, products come and go. Usually we move 3-4 times a year. Noogler onboarding is often forgotten. There's a story about a noogler haunting the buildings for 2 months before finding out whom he reported to. I'm not sure if that ever happened, but I've seen people wandering around for several days. (Now I have the routine to spot them and help finding their team.)  Long working hours and stress. This is most prevalent in SRE, but many development teams experience it, too.  Cult vocabulary. There are hundreds of words for common things. On top of that, all projects have their internal codenames, and sometimes 3-4 different names refer to the same thing. You can speak whole sentences with words that only googlers understand. Willpower, Ikea, magnet, batman, etc.: those words do not mean what you think they mean.  Location-specific issues. The company is centered around Mountain View, and you are almost certainly required to move there if you become important. Other sites (especially non-US sites) provide significantly less perks and choices. Mountain View is extremely crowded, and facilities can't keep up with the growth. Property prices are crazily inflated by googlers, and traffic is bad for the same reason. London still has some office space, but it pays much less than other sites, while living costs are the same or higher. The company sets the salaries based purely on industry average, not on living costs. The London benchmark seems to be flawed. You can't afford to rent any decent flat near the office, and commute is awful during peak times. Offices are open plan everywhere. Waiting for male toilets is very common at most sites. With regards to quality of life, the Zurich site is the most livable in Europe, and maybe New York in the US (until Eric Schmidt applies his stupid crowdedness-makes-you-creative theory).","Allow people to focus on one thing, even if it slows growth down.

Great project opportunities.","Management is generally appalling, I literally have never encountered people with less ability to lead and motivate people and just understand the basic dynamics of people. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Even though they are participating highly both in terms of operations and projects. Managers make false underhanded promises about being kept on to many contractors in the hope that this will motivate people to work even harder. But people talk and such strategies become transparent. It is embarrassing spending so much money on parties/off-sites etc. while the contractors slave away and then are told there is no budget to keep them on. (Many of them are far more intelligent than the FTEs and working much harder, and it feels like they know that and are just using them for as much as they can) Googlers have a tendency to become entitled and egotistical. Yes, the physical workplace is great, but it is too much of a bubble and actually the environment is stressful and not really all that friendly. Even the Kitchen staff seem miserable. The expectation of excellence is fraught in the air, which often results in an underhanded competitiveness between team members and long, long working hours. Ya those pool tables are nice, but I never really had time to play them. Googlers are too mono, there is no diversity in thought, age, race etc. Which is a huge criticism really when you think of the values they hide behind and the people they should be considering. If you strip away the benefits and the incredible value of having Google on your CV, this would have been one of the worst employment experiences in my life. I think the difficulty is getting to grips with the frustration of how they are perceived, and how they actually operate. Many of the FTEs have worked nowhere but Google and think they are uber fantastic for having landed a job there and what they are doing is the most important thing in the world but there lack of life experience shows massively in how they handle their work and many of them feel like they are part of a cult.","Get over yourself and drop that ego.

In all my career, the only place I've worked that was even comparable to Google was Wells Fargo (which was a ridiculously unfulfilling place to work as an engineer).  Additionally, the culture at Google is very snobby compared to other places I've worked. Managers love to reiterate lines like ""we hire the smartest people in the world"", and a lot of people seem to eat it up. One could argue that this is harmless placating, but the level of groupthink present all over the organization is appalling. Many even consider ""not invented here"" a legitimate reason to build something from scratch, even when there's more robust free software out there (I've been pressured into doing this several times, since the approval process for 3rd party code is so painstakingly bureaucratic).  Lastly, I don't feel valued, respected, or even acknowledged by managers. I end up working nights and weekends every week because of clear organizational mistakes being made by managers or other teams. I have been told personally by a manager that a reason for me being pigeonholed into a role I hated was because I didn't go to a top tier school (since another placation they often throw around is that Google is way harder to get into than an Ivy League school, this does once again seem irrelevant). The worst part is that most people don't listen about these things, the times I've told people that we are underorganized and it's going to cause problems later, the general response is to ignore it and/or not be proactive.","Your processes are broken.

Sideways mobility between software engineering groups. The scale of its operations are amazing. For its size, it is still one of the best companies to work for. It is very well run. Perks. A culture that doesn't prohibit fun, and in some sense encourages it.","Long hours: It depends on the individual, but it's easy to feel that you need to produce more and ending up selling yourself short. The work involves a lot of time wasting ""archaeology"" - sifting through wikis, code labs and other people's code figuring out what is the latest recommended way to do something that sounds boiler-plate and obvious, so it's easy to feel unproductive at times. Also, the availability of free food, gym, etc. on campus and the plenty of fun distractions on its corp network make it easy to spend more time there.  Hard to be visible and make an impact. Visibility and Impact are the economy by which software engineers are measured, and they are becoming harder to come by. I feel that most joining now are likely to end up being just a number: average (in Google standards) impact and zero visibility, irrespective of how much of a rock star they were in their previous jobs.  It's becoming more and more the target of lawsuits, which basically means that legal fees will continue to cut a larger share of its revenues. In general, operating margins have been decreasing, although they are still amazing. I'm not saying that legal fees are the reason for decreasing operating margins. Google is investing heavily (in new hires, acquisitions, etc) and any benefits from this spike in investment will take some time to catch up with the costs, and there is no guarantee that they ever will.  I am a relatively recent (post-recession) hire, and after way over a year on the job I still feel that I am evaluating Google and wondering whether I can have a career here, which is not a good sign. Compared to previous jobs, I feel less recognized, having to work more, less proud of my work, and being more conscious on the effect that specific projects will have on my career instead of just doing what is right for the users/company. It is not that I am less smart/capable/experienced than others, it's just that the opportunities are less compared to someone who joined earlier. The work is not the most interesting I ever done, but it is OK and gives me the opportunity to expand my technical breadth. If this is all Google needs from me, then I am likely to move on, more sooner than later, and if this is a common experience of the relatively recent hires then the smartest and the brightest will not be flocking to Google anymore. Nothing particularly wrong with Google, I assume that's part of a company's normal progression from start-up to behemoth, and I still recommend giving Google a try, especially for new grads as it can be a good place to jump-start an engineering career.

During the internship, I had many 1:1 meetings with my manager who offered good advice and feedback about the project I was given.  Great brand name on the CV.","For my first week, I was given the task of working in the ""AdWords Approval Bin"" - a place where all automatically disapproved ads are kept and individually screened by Google employees. Many interns were given this for a week or two. Some people apparently spent half their internship doing it. Its not challenging nor stimulating - its very repetitive.  Although they do give interns big projects, from my experience very few of the projects (especially if they are focused on AdWords) will be implemented. This is due to the fact that most changes to AdWords are typically incremental and only seem to tweak what has already proved itself to be a very succesful product.","From what I heard from other interns, most had secured their position through a referral.

Great positive environment if you are in one of the few projects with an excellent manager. Brand name: it will help a lot to have Google on your resumé when you'll run away.","Most managers are jokes and if you are not their pet employee will barely know you exist. This mean that on quarterly and annual review your manager will inflate the work done by his favorite employees and strongly back their deserving for a bonus, promotion etc, while having little to say to the committees about the value of your work. If promotions are rare and reserved for a select few, raises are almost non-existent and far below inflation.  20% time mean you have to sleep less and work more during the week and forget about weekends. The running joke is that 20% percent means you work 20% more time than the current 140% time you spend on a fictional 40h work week.  Taking vacation lower your performance ratings resulting in lower bonus and less chance for a promotion or raise. Same goes for sick days, parental leave, or even for being unreachable on a weekend (while not on call).  Some of my coworkers had to complain to HR about their managers and got little support. HR would not recognize any wrongdoing and downplay issues as personality mismatch and misunderstandings. I've witnessed situations unblock with HR only after a VP was contacted for help by the employee.","Get back in touch with the grumpy people, they are saying out loud what the majority is thinking silently. Of course you'll have old timers that are in a niche and know the right people to love how they are being treated, also you have the happy newbies that are not disappointed yet of not being recognized after a full year of hard working. Grumpiness is usually dismissed as 'entitlement' from some employees, but these same employees accepted lower salaries to join Google in exchange for working in Lala Land, of course they are grumpy when they wake up.  Make the career development efforts real, making bigger promisees without actually delivering real results will just frustrate the employees more. Develop and facilitate exchange programs between roles, but not limited to 10-20 people, that's not how you satisfy 10000 unsatisfied employees. Requiring that you be a top top performer in your current role is ridiculous, if the employees want to try something else it's probably because they not so happy in their current role and not performing at their full potential.  One way to improve career development and work life balance is to have *strong* incentives for managers to truly support *all* their employees to do 20% time, career development, work life balance. Also force the manager to take their vacation days, instead of setting the benchmark of working all the time. A manager that lose several his direct reports in a few months and unable to hiring replacements should be harshly sanctioned, not promoted.  Conduct surveys more often, one Googlegeist per year does not seem to help that much when it takes so much time to react and see the results. Open the committees to silent attendants, so employees can see how the process truly works, instead of hearsay and the 'official' guidelines. Create incentives for work/life balance, it's fine to reward the workaholics but too much of it, as it is now, destroys team morale.  React *now*, it will be too late after mid-september when I predict a massive exodus of under-appreciated talented people.

7717,7718,google,none," May 15, 2009",Former Employee - Quality Rater,"Horribly Unsatisfying Communication, Enjoyable Work","My story is a little different than most others because I was a temp worker for Google, testing search results for a year. I enjoyed the work a great deal, there were always new interesting things to test, and I got to see things like Maps and Timelines long before they were released to the public and help make them better. The pay was reasonable - $15/hour working from home - and there were good bonuses after a certain number of hours had been completed, or occasionally given for working on specific projects.","There were two major downsides of doing temp work from home for Google. One was the astonishing lack of communication. This shifted a little while I was working there, they began developing a sort of report card system so that we could see how our rating work scored compared to previous months and how we were doing overall. But while I was there, that system only worked for a small fraction of the projects I was working on, so it wasn't particularly helpful.  More to the point, there was no positive feedback given to anyone at all, and communication between employees seemed to be discouraged - two classic characteristics of a dysfunctional work environment. Occasionally if a rating was very far off of what they were looking for - usually due to a typo or misclick - they would send it back with a warning saying so, but that represented the sum total of feedback given. Personally, I found it very difficult to work with no input about whether they wished I were going faster, whether I was going faster than my peers, whether I was doing a great job, or - most of all - any input about how to improve in general. Sure, it's a year-long temp job, but one which can potentially be repeated after another year has passed - and besides, who doesn't want to receive positive feedback and learn how to improve and receive more? I guess more importantly, who doesn't want to know what the expectations for their work are??  The one saving grace for me was that I found a forum for people working from home where some other folks who were doing temp work for Google could get together and chat a little - without breaking any confidentiality agreements - about what we struggled with, how much we were able to do in a day, and what we thought the expectations for us were, based on all of our experiences.  The other major downside was that the temp agency they used, WorkForceLogic, was just TERRIBLE - specifically at handling payroll, which is a terrible thing to be terrible at. There were many times that I didn't get paid, got a bonus deducted from my check instead of added to it, et cetera - and it was always a different mistake from all the ones they had made before, and it always took them a while to figure out what had gone wrong, track down whoever needed to fix it, wait for them to get back from lunch or an appointment or come back to work the next day or.... And they were no better at communication, really, I had hoped that once this assignment was up I would be able to get more assignments through WFL, but no matter how many phone calls I made, nobody could ever figure out who I should be talking to or find anyone who would return calls.","From what I have heard, communication and job satisfaction are a growing problem everywhere in Google, and as with any large corporation this has the largest effect at the bottom of the totem pole.

I've seen a lot of other companies from the outside, as a former strategy consultant, and Google's more extraordinary than a lot of those on the inside realise. The culture's very transparent (though that may reflect function / geography) and impressively flat. Which isn't to say there aren't title and salary differences, but that fantastic people with lowly titles are given the space and encouragement to do fantastic things.","As the organisation grows, the 'flatness' of it makes it pretty exhausting: there are too many other people and functions to deal with, and very little opportunity to delegate responsibility. A corollary of is that you're valued and recognised in proportion to how you're viewed by those many other people, which favours those who're noisiest. Self-promotion and internal marketing for yourself and your projects is (usually) something you need to take time over if you're going to do well here, and that's a pity because it's mostly unproductive - in the sense that the company or the projects don't improve much for you shouting about them.","There's been a lot of work, this calendar year, on improving internal mobility between roles and functions and that's admirable. Now that horizontal mobility's being addressed properly, it's time for a fresh look at vertical mobility. It's not an easy problem: it's very difficult to combine what's best about the culture (that it's flat and that people are not micro-managed, at least in Marketing / Product / Eng) with highly-objective and insightful reviews by managers: those managers just don't have enough data to go on. But it still feels like there's improvement potential here. Another, unrelated suggestion: the free-wheeling, bottom-up approach to product strategy and prioritisation we have isn't cutting it any more. There are fundamental issues with a lot of the products we're hoping to make money out of or drive adoption for, and those issues are being addressed too slowly. We're betting too generously on too many products, as well.  For all the whingeing, though, senior management are very impressive and really care about making it a good place.
